    <h1>Exodus 34 - Literal Translation</h1>

    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    And the LORD (YHWH - I AM) said unto Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.</p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai (Sina - thorn), and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.</p>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.</p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai (Sina - thorn), as the LORD (YHWH - I AM) had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.</p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    And the LORD (YHWH - I AM) descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD (YHWH - I AM).</p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    And the LORD (YHWH - I AM) passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD (YHWH - I AM), The LORD (YHWH - I AM) God (Elohim - God), merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,</p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.</p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    And Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.</p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord (Adonai - My Lord), let my Lord (Adonai - My Lord) I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.</p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD (YHWH - I AM); for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.</p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite (Emori - western), and the Canaanite (Kana'ani - merchant), and the Hittite (Chitti - fear), and the Perizzite (Perizzi - village dweller), and the Hivite (Chivvi - life), and the Jebusite (Yevusi - threshing floor).</p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:</p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:</p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD (YHWH - I AM), whose name is Jealous (Qanna - jealous), is a jealous God (Elohim - God):</p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;</p>

    <p><strong>16. </strong>
    And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.</p>

    <p><strong>17. </strong>
    Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.</p>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib (Abib - ear of grain); for in the month Abib (Abib - ear of grain) thou camest out from Egypt (Mitzrayim - narrow place).</p>

    <p><strong>19. </strong>
    All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.</p>

    <p><strong>20. </strong>
    But the firstling of an ass (Chamor - donkey) thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.</p>

    <p><strong>21. </strong>
    Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.</p>

    <p><strong>22. </strong>
    And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.</p>

    <p><strong>23. </strong>
    Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the LORD (YHWH - I AM) God (Elohim - God), the God (Elohim - God) of Israel (Yisrael - He who struggles with God).</p>

    <p><strong>24. </strong>
    For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD (YHWH - I AM) thy God (Elohim - God) thrice in the year.</p>

    <p><strong>25. </strong>
    Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.</p>

    <p><strong>26. </strong>
    The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD (YHWH - I AM) thy God (Elohim - God). Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.</p>

    <p><strong>27. </strong>
    And the LORD (YHWH - I AM) said unto Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel (Yisrael - He who struggles with God).</p>

    <p><strong>28. </strong>
    And he was there with the LORD (YHWH - I AM) forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments (Aseret Ha'Dibrot - Ten Words).</p>

    <p><strong>29. </strong>
    And it came to pass, when Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) came down from mount Sinai (Sina - thorn) with the two tables of testimony in Moses' (Mosheh - drawn out) hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.</p>

    <p><strong>30. </strong>
    And when Aaron (Aharon - exalted) and all the children of Israel (Yisrael - He who struggles with God) saw Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.</p>

    <p><strong>31. </strong>
    And Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) called unto them; and Aaron (Aharon - exalted) and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) talked with them.</p>

    <p><strong>32. </strong>
    And afterward all the children of Israel (Yisrael - He who struggles with God) came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD (YHWH - I AM) had spoken with him in mount Sinai (Sina - thorn).</p>

    <p><strong>33. </strong>
    And till Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.</p>

    <p><strong>34. </strong>
    But when Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) went in before the LORD (YHWH - I AM) to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel (Yisrael - He who struggles with God) that which he was commanded.</p>

    <p><strong>35. </strong>
    And the children of Israel (Yisrael - He who struggles with God) saw the face of Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), that the skin of Moses' (Mosheh - drawn out) face shone: and Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</p>
