    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    They set out (Nasa - set out) from Elim (Eilim - Elim), and all the congregation (Edah - congregation) of the people (Am - people) of Israel (Yisra'el - Israel) came to the wilderness (Midbar - wilderness) of Sin (Sin - Sin), which is between Elim (Eilim - Elim) and Sinai (Sina - Sinai), on the fifteenth day (Yom - day) of the second month (Chodesh - month), after they had departed (Yatsa - departed) from the land (Eretz - land) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt). </p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    And the people (Am - people) of Israel (Yisra'el - Israel) said to them (Amar - said), "Would that we had died (Muth - died) by the hand (Yad - hand) of the Lord (YHWH - Lord) in the land (Eretz - land) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt), when we sat (Yashav - sat) by the meat pots (Habasar - meat pots) and ate (Akal - ate) bread (Lechem - bread) to the full (Saba - full), for you have brought us out (Yatsa - brought out) into this wilderness (Midbar - wilderness) to kill (Harag - kill) this whole assembly (Edah - assembly) with hunger (Ra'av - hunger)." </p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    Then the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said (Amar - said) to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "Behold, I will rain (Matar - rain) bread (Lechem - bread) from heaven (Shamayim - heaven) for you, and the people (Am - people) shall go out (Yatsa - go out) and gather (Lakach - gather) a day's portion (D'gan - portion) every day (Yom - day), that I may test (Nasa - test) them, whether they will walk (Halakh - walk) in my law (Torah - law) or not." </p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    On the sixth day (Yom - day) when they prepare (Asah - prepare) what they bring in (Bo - bring in), it will be twice as much (Mishneh - twice as much) as they gather (Lakach - gather) daily (Yom - day)." </p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    So Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - Aaron) said (Amar - said) to all the people (Am - people) of Israel (Yisra'el - Israel), "At evening (Erev - evening) you shall know (Yada - know) that it was the Lord (YHWH - Lord) who brought you out (Yatsa - brought you out) of the land (Eretz - land) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt), </p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    and in the morning (Boker - morning) you shall see (Ra'ah - see) the glory (Kavod - glory) of the Lord (YHWH - Lord), because he has heard (Shama - heard) your grumbling (Lun - grumbling) against the Lord (YHWH - Lord). For what are we (Mah - we), that you grumble (Lun - grumble) against us?" </p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    And Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) said (Amar - said), "When the Lord (YHWH - Lord) gives you in the evening (Erev - evening) meat (Basar - meat) to eat (Akal - eat) and in the morning (Boker - morning) bread (Lechem - bread) to the full (Saba - full), because the Lord (YHWH - Lord) has heard (Shama - heard) your grumbling (Lun - grumbling) that you grumble (Lun - grumble) against himâ€”what are we? Your grumbling (Lun - grumbling) is not against us but against the Lord (YHWH - Lord)." </p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    Then Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) said (Amar - said) to Aaron (Aharon - Aaron), "Say (Amar - say) to the whole congregation (Edah - congregation) of the people (Am - people) of Israel (Yisra'el - Israel), 'Come near (Nagash - come near) before the Lord (YHWH - Lord), for he has heard (Shama - heard) your grumbling (Lun - grumbling).'" </p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    And as Aaron (Aharon - Aaron) spoke (Dabar - spoke) to the whole congregation (Edah - congregation) of the people (Am - people) of Israel (Yisra'el - Israel), they looked toward the wilderness (Midbar - wilderness), and behold, the glory (Kavod - glory) of the Lord (YHWH - Lord) appeared (Ra'ah - appeared) in the cloud (Anan - cloud). </p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    And the Lord (YHWH - Lord) spoke (Dabar - spoke) to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), saying (Amar - saying), </p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    "I have heard (Shama - heard) the grumbling (Lun - grumbling) of the people (Am - people) of Israel (Yisra'el - Israel). Say (Amar - say) to them, 'At twilight (Ben Ha'arbayim - twilight) you shall eat (Akal - eat) meat (Basar - meat), and in the morning (Boker - morning) you shall be filled (Saba - filled) with bread (Lechem - bread). Then you shall know (Yada - know) that I am the Lord (YHWH - Lord) your God (Elohim - God).'" </p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    In the evening (Erev - evening) quail (Salav - quail) came up (Alah - came up) and covered (Kasal - covered) the camp (Machaneh - camp), and in the morning (Boker - morning) dew (Tal - dew) lay (Natah - lay) around the camp (Machaneh - camp). </p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    And when the dew (Tal - dew) had gone up (Alah - gone up), there was on the face (Panim - face) of the wilderness (Midbar - wilderness) a fine (Tze'erah - fine) flake-like thing (Kash - flake) as fine as frost (Tseltsal - frost) on the ground (Adamah - ground). </p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    When the people (Am - people) of Israel (Yisra'el - Israel) saw it (Ra'ah - saw it), they said (Amar - said) to one another (Ish - one another), "What is it (Man - it)?" For they did not know (Yada - know) what it was. And Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) said (Amar - said) to them, "It is the bread (Lechem - bread) that the Lord (YHWH - Lord) has given you to eat (Akal - eat)."</p>

    <p><strong>16. </strong>
    This is what the Lord (YHWH - Lord) has commanded (Tsavah - commanded): 'Gather of it (Lakach - gather), each one (Ish - one) of you, as much as he can eat (Akal - eat); you shall take (Lakach - take) an omer (Omer - omer) per person (Nefesh - person), according to the number (Mishpar - number) of the persons (Nefesh - persons) that each of you has in his tent (Ohel - tent).'" </p>

    <p><strong>17. </strong>
    And the people (Am - people) of Israel (Yisra'el - Israel) did so (Asah - did so). They gathered (Lakach - gathered) some more (Yoter - more), some less (M'at - less). </p>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    But when they measured it (Mideh - measured) with an omer (Omer - omer), whoever gathered (Lakach - gathered) much (Yoter - much) had nothing (Ein - nothing) left over (Yeter - left over), and whoever gathered (Lakach - gathered) little (M'at - little) had no lack (Chasar - lack). Each of them gathered (Lakach - gathered) as much as he could eat (Akal - eat). </p>

    <p><strong>19. </strong>
    And Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) said (Amar - said) to them, "Let no one (Ish - one) leave any of it (Mishal - it) till the morning (Boker - morning)." </p>

    <p><strong>20. </strong>
    But they did not listen (Shama - listen) to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out). Some left part of it (Cheleq - part of it) till the morning (Boker - morning), and it bred (Sha'ar - bred) worms (Tola'im - worms) and stank (Tz'ah - stank). And Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) was angry (Charah - angry) with them. </p>

    <p><strong>21. </strong>
    Morning by morning (Boker - morning), they gathered (Lakach - gathered) it, each as much as he could eat (Akal - eat). But when the sun (Shemesh - sun) grew hot (Chamah - hot), it melted (Meltah - melted). </p>
