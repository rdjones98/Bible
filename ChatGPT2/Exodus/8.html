    <h1>Exodus 8</h1>

    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    Then the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "Go to Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) and say to him, 'Thus says the Lord (YHWH - Lord), "Let my people go (Shalach - send), that they may serve (Avad - serve) me."'</p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    But if you refuse (Mane'a - refuse) to let them go (Shalach - send), behold, I will plague (Nagaf - strike) all your territory (Gevul - border) with frogs (Tzfarde'a - frogs). </p>
	<br><img src=8.heqet.jpg></img><i>Heqet - Goddess of Fertility (Frog).  She is powerless to stop the overpopulation of frogs</i><br>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    The Nile (Yor - Nile) shall swarm with frogs (Tzfarde'a - frogs), which shall come up (Alah - come up) into your house, into your bedroom, and on your bed, into the houses (Beyt - houses) of your servants, and your people, and into your ovens (Tanin - ovens) and your kneading bowls (Mish'ar - kneading bowls). </p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    The frogs (Tzfarde'a - frogs) shall come up (Alah - come up) on you and your people and all your servants." </p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    And the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses , "Say to Aaron (Aharon - exalted), 'Stretch out (Natah - stretch out) your hand (Yad - hand) with your staff (Mateh - staff) over the streams (Nahar - streams), over the rivers (Nahar - rivers), and over the ponds (B'irot - ponds), and cause frogs (Tzfarde'a - frogs) to come up (Alah - come up) on the land (Eretz - land) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt).'" </p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    So Aaron (Aharon - exalted) stretched out (Natah - stretched out) his hand (Yad - hand) over the waters (Mayim - waters) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt), and the frogs (Tzfarde'a - frogs) came up (Alah - came up) and covered (Kavah - covered) the land (Eretz - land) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt). </p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    But the magicians (Lechash - magicians) did the same by their secret arts (Kesem - magic) and brought (Bo - brought) up frogs (Tzfarde'a - frogs) on the land (Eretz - land) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt). </p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    Then Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) called Moses  and Aaron (Aharon - exalted) and said, "Entreat (Patah - plead) the Lord (YHWH - Lord) to take away (Kalah - remove) the frogs (Tzfarde'a - frogs) from me and from my people, and I will let the people go (Shalach - send), that they may sacrifice (Zabach - sacrifice) to the Lord (YHWH - Lord)." </p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    Moses  said to Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh), "Be pleased (Chafetz - be pleased) to command (Tsavah - command) me when I am to entreat (Patah - plead) for you and for your servants and for your people, that the frogs (Tzfarde'a - frogs) be cut off (Katah - cut off) from you and your houses (Beyt - houses) and be left only in the Nile (Yor - Nile)." </p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    And he said, "Tomorrow (Machar - tomorrow)." Moses  said, "Be it as you say, so that you may know (Yadah - know) that there is no one like (Kamah - like) the Lord (YHWH - Lord) our God (Elohim - God). </p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    The frogs (Tzfarde'a - frogs) shall depart (Suwr - depart) from you and your houses (Beyt - houses) and from your servants and your people; they shall be left (Yats'a - leave) only in the Nile (Yor - Nile)." </p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    So Moses  and Aaron (Aharon - exalted) went out from Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh), and Moses  cried (Za'aq - cried) to the Lord (YHWH - Lord) about the frogs (Tzfarde'a - frogs), as he had agreed (Dabar - said) with Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh). </p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    And the Lord (YHWH - Lord) did according to the word (Dabar - word) of Moses ; the frogs (Tzfarde'a - frogs) died (Muwt - died) out of the houses (Beyt - houses), the courts (Chatser - courts), and the fields (Sadeh - fields). </p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    And they gathered (Asaph - gathered) them together in heaps (Goren - heap), and the land (Eretz - land) stank (Sha'ar - stank). </p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    But when Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) that there was a respite (Racham - relief), he hardened (Chazak - hardened) his heart (Lev - heart) and would not listen (Shama - listen) to them, as the Lord (YHWH - Lord) had said. </p>

    <p><strong>16. </strong>
    Then the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses , "Say to Aaron (Aharon - exalted), 'Stretch out (Natah - stretch out) your staff (Mateh - staff) and strike (Naga - strike) the dust (Aphar - dust) of the earth (Erets - earth), that it may become gnats (Kinim - gnats) throughout all the land (Eretz - land) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt).'" </p>

    <p><strong>17. </strong>
    And they did so. Aaron (Aharon - exalted) stretched out (Natah - stretched out) his staff (Mateh - staff) and struck (Naga - struck) the dust (Aphar - dust) of the earth (Erets - earth), and there were gnats (Kinim - gnats) on man (Ish - man) and beast (Behemah - beast). All the dust (Aphar - dust) of the earth (Erets - earth) became gnats (Kinim - gnats) throughout all the land (Eretz - land) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt). </p>
	<br><img src=8.geb.jpg></img><i>Geb - God of Earth(goose).  God turns the dust of the earth to gnats and Geb is powerless.</i><br>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    The magicians (Lechash - magicians) tried by their secret arts (Kesem - magic) to produce gnats (Kinim - gnats), but they could not (Lo - not). So there were gnats (Kinim - gnats) on man (Ish - man) and beast (Behemah - beast). </p>

    <p><strong>19. </strong>
    The magicians (Lechash - magicians) said to Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh), "This is the finger (Etzba - finger) of God (Elohim - God)!" But Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh)'s heart (Lev - heart) was hardened (Chazak - hardened), and he would not listen (Shama - listen) to them, as the Lord (YHWH - Lord) had said. </p>

    <p><strong>20. </strong>
    Then the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses , "Rise early and present yourself (Natan - stand) before Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) as he goes out (Yatsa - goes out) to the water (Mayim - water), and say to him, 'Thus says the Lord (YHWH - Lord), "Let my people go (Shalach - send), that they may serve (Avad - serve) me."'</p>

    <p><strong>21. </strong>
    Otherwise, if you will not let my people go (Shalach - send), behold, I will send (Shalach - send) swarms (Arov - swarms) of flies (T'ze'rah - flies) on you and your servants and your people, and into your houses (Beyt - houses); and the houses (Beyt - houses) of the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egypt) shall be full of swarms (Arov - swarms) of flies (T'ze'rah - flies), and also the ground (Adamah - ground) on which they stand (Amad - stand). </p>
	
	<p><strong>22. </strong>
    But on that day (Yom - day) I will set apart (Pala - set apart) the land (Eretz - land) of Goshen (Goshen - Goshen), where my people dwell (Yashav - dwell), so that no swarms (Arov - swarms) of flies (Zav - flies) shall be there, that you may know (Yada - know) that I am the Lord (YHWH - Lord) in the midst (Tavek - midst) of the earth (Eretz - earth). </p>
	<br><img src=8.khepri.png></img><i>Khepri - God of Creation, Movement of the Sun and Rebirth.  The flies are a sign of decay and death</i><br>

    <p><strong>23. </strong>
    I will put a division (P'ruz - division) between my people and your people. Tomorrow (Machar - tomorrow) this sign (Oth - sign) shall happen (Hayah - happen)." </p>

    <p><strong>24. </strong>
    And the Lord (YHWH - Lord) did so. There came great swarms (Arov - swarms) of flies (Zav - flies) into the house (Bayit - house) of Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh), and into his servants' houses (Bet - houses), and the land (Eretz - land) was ruined (Shachat - ruined) by the swarms (Arov - swarms) of flies (Zav - flies). </p>

    <p><strong>25. </strong>
    Then Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) called Moses  and Aaron (Aharon - Aaron) and said, "Go, sacrifice (Zabach - sacrifice) to your God (Elohim - God) within the land (Eretz - land)." </p>

    <p><strong>26. </strong>
    But Moses  said, "It would not be right (Tov - right) to do so (Asah - do so), for the offerings (Zebach - offerings) we sacrifice (Zabach - sacrifice) to the Lord (YHWH - Lord) our God (Elohim - God) are an abomination (To'evah - abomination) to the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians). If we sacrifice (Zabach - sacrifice) offerings (Zebach - offerings) to the Lord (YHWH - Lord) our God (Elohim - God) before their eyes (Ayin - eyes), will they not stone (Sakal - stone) us?" </p>

    <p><strong>27. </strong>
    We must go three days' journey into the wilderness (Midbar - wilderness) and sacrifice (Zabach - sacrifice) to the Lord (YHWH - Lord) our God (Elohim - God) as he tells (Dabar - tells) us." </p>

    <p><strong>28. </strong>
    So Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) said, "I will let you go, to sacrifice (Zabach - sacrifice) to the Lord (YHWH - Lord) your God (Elohim - God) in the wilderness (Midbar - wilderness), only you must not go very far (Ra'ah - far). Plead (Hana - plead) for me." </p>

    <p><strong>29. </strong>
    Then Moses  said, "Behold, I am going out (Yatsa - going out) from you, and I will plead (Hana - plead) with the Lord (YHWH - Lord) that the swarms (Arov - swarms) of flies (Zav - flies) may depart (Suwr - depart) from Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh), from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow (Machar - tomorrow); only let not Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) cheat (Ramah - cheat) again by not letting the people go to sacrifice (Zabach - sacrifice) to the Lord (YHWH - Lord)." </p>

    <p><strong>30. </strong>
    So Moses  went out from Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) and prayed (Palah - prayed) to the Lord (YHWH - Lord). </p>

    <p><strong>31. </strong>
    And the Lord (YHWH - Lord) did as Moses  asked, and removed (Suwr - removed) the swarms (Arov - swarms) of flies (Zav - flies) from Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh), from his servants, and from his people; not one remained (Natar - remained). </p>

    <p><strong>32. </strong>
    But Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) hardened (Chazaq - hardened) his heart (Lev - heart) this time also, and did not let the people go. </p>
