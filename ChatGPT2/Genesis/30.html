 So she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I’ll die!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-833" class="text Gen-30-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Jacob became angry with her and said, “Am I in the place of God,
 who has kept you from having children?”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-834" class="text Gen-30-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Then she said, “Here is Bilhah,
 my servant.
 Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and I too can build a family through her.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-835" class="text Gen-30-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife.
 Jacob slept with her,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-836" class="text Gen-30-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>and she became pregnant and bore him a son.</span> <span id="en-NIV-837" class="text Gen-30-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me;
 he has listened to my plea and given me a son.”
 Because of this she named him Dan.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-837a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-837a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-837a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>

 conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.</span> <span id="en-NIV-839" class="text Gen-30-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Then Rachel said, “I have had a great struggle with my sister, and I have won.”

 Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants,

</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-847" class="text Gen-30-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. “You must sleep with me,” she said. “I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.”
 So he slept with her that night.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-848" class="text Gen-30-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>God listened to Leah,

 and said, “May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> add to me another son.”
</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-856" class="text Gen-30-25">Jacob’s Flocks Increase</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-30-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way
 so I can go back to my own homeland.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-857" class="text Gen-30-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Give me my wives and children, for whom I have served you,
 and I will be on my way. You know how much work I’ve done for you.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-858" class="text Gen-30-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes,
 please stay. I have learned by divination
 that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has blessed me because of you.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-859" class="text Gen-30-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>He added, “Name your wages,
 and I will pay them.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-860" class="text Gen-30-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Jacob said to him, “You know how I have worked for you
 and how your livestock has fared under my care.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-861" class="text Gen-30-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has blessed you wherever I have been.
 But now, when may I do something for my own household?
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-862" class="text Gen-30-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>“What shall I give you?” he asked.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-30-31">“Don’t give me anything,” Jacob replied. “But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them:</span> <span id="en-NIV-863" class="text Gen-30-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat.
 They will be my wages.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-864" class="text Gen-30-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored,
 will be considered stolen.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-865" class="text Gen-30-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>“Agreed,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-866" class="text Gen-30-35"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs,
 and he placed them in the care of his sons.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-867" class="text Gen-30-36"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>Then he put a three-day journey
 between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban’s flocks.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-868" class="text Gen-30-37"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond
 and plane trees
 and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-869" class="text Gen-30-38"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>Then he placed the peeled branches
 in all the watering troughs,
 so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat
 and came to drink,</span> <span id="en-NIV-870" class="text Gen-30-39"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>they mated in front of the branches.
 And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-871" class="text Gen-30-40"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals
 that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban’s animals.</span> <span id="en-NIV-872" class="text Gen-30-41"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>Whenever the stronger females were in heat,
 Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-873" class="text Gen-30-42"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup>but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-874" class="text Gen-30-43"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup>In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
