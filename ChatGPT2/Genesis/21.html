 as he had said, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> did for Sarah what he had promised.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-516" class="text Gen-21-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Sarah became pregnant and bore a son
 to Abraham in his old age,
 at the very time God had promised him.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-517" class="text Gen-21-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Abraham gave the name Isaac<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-517a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-517a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-517a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>

 when his son Isaac was born to him.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-520" class="text Gen-21-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Sarah said, “God has brought me laughter,
 and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-521" class="text Gen-21-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>And she added, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”
</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-522" class="text Gen-21-8">Hagar and Ishmael Sent Away</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-21-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The child grew and was weaned,
 and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast.</span> <span id="en-NIV-523" class="text Gen-21-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham
 was mocking,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-524" class="text Gen-21-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>and she said to Abraham, “Get rid of that slave woman
 and her son, for that woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-525" class="text Gen-21-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-526" class="text Gen-21-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>But God said to him, “Do not be so distressed about the boy and your slave woman.

</span> <span id="en-NIV-527" class="text Gen-21-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>I will make the son of the slave into a nation
 also, because he is your offspring.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-528" class="text Gen-21-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar.
 He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the Desert of Beersheba.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-529" class="text Gen-21-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes.</span> <span id="en-NIV-530" class="text Gen-21-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then she went off and sat down about a bowshot away, for she thought, “I cannot watch the boy die.” And as she sat there, she<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-530c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-530c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-530c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> began to sob.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-531" class="text Gen-21-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>God heard the boy crying,
 and the angel of God
 called to Hagar from heaven
 and said to her, “What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid;

”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-533" class="text Gen-21-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Then God opened her eyes
 and she saw a well of water.
 So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-534" class="text Gen-21-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>God was with the boy
 as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer.</span> <span id="en-NIV-535" class="text Gen-21-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>While he was living in the Desert of Paran,
 his mother got a wife for him
 from Egypt.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-536" class="text Gen-21-22">The Treaty at Beersheba</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-21-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>At that time Abimelek
 and Phicol the commander of his forces
 said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-537" class="text Gen-21-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Now swear
 to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants.
 Show to me and the country where you now reside as a foreigner the same kindness I have shown to you.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-538" class="text Gen-21-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Abraham said, “I swear it.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-539" class="text Gen-21-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Then Abraham complained to Abimelek about a well of water that Abimelek’s servants had seized.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-540" class="text Gen-21-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>But Abimelek said, “I don’t know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-541" class="text Gen-21-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelek, and the two men made a treaty.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-542" class="text Gen-21-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock,</span> <span id="en-NIV-543" class="text Gen-21-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>and Abimelek asked Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-544" class="text Gen-21-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>He replied, “Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness
 that I dug this well.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-545" class="text Gen-21-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>So that place was called Beersheba,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-545d' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-545d&quot; title=&quot;See footnote d&quot;&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-545d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>
 because the two men swore an oath
 there.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-546" class="text Gen-21-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>After the treaty
 had been made at Beersheba,
 Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces
 returned to the land of the Philistines.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-547" class="text Gen-21-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>Abraham planted a tamarisk tree
 in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,
 the Eternal God.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-548" class="text Gen-21-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines
