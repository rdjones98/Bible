    <h1>Exodus 3</h1>

    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    Now Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) was taking care of the flock of Jethro (Yitro - his excellence), his father-in-law (Choten - father-in-law), the priest (Kohen - priest) of Midian (Midyan - strife). He led the flock to the far side (Achar - back) of the desert (Midbar - wilderness) and came to the mountain (Har - mountain) of God (Elohim - God), to Horeb (Chorev - desolation).</p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    The angel (Mal'akh - angel) of the LORD (YHWH - I AM) appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. Moses looked, and saw that the bush was burning with fire, but it was not being consumed (Kalal - consumed).</p>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) said, "I will turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burned up."</p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    When the LORD (YHWH - I AM) saw that Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) had turned aside to look, God (Elohim - God) called him from the midst of the bush, and said, "Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), Moses (Mosheh - drawn out)!" And Moses answered, "Here I am (Hineni - here I am)."</p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    God (Elohim - God) said, "Do not come any closer. Take off your sandals because the place where you are standing is holy ground."</p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    He continued, "I am the God (Elohim - God) of your father (Av - father), the God (Elohim - God) of Abraham (Avraham - father of many), the God (Elohim - God) of Isaac (Yitzhak - laughter), and the God (Elohim - God) of Jacob (Yaakov - supplanted)." Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) hid his face (Panim - face) because he was afraid (Yare - afraid) to look at God (Elohim - God).</p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    The LORD (YHWH - I AM) said, "I have certainly seen the suffering (Oneh - affliction) of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their cry because of their taskmasters (Nasa - burden bearers). I know their pain (Mak'ov - sorrow),</p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    and I have come down (Yarad - come down) to rescue them from the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians), and to bring them up out of that land to a good (Tov - good) and spacious (Ravah - large) land, a land flowing with milk (Halav - milk) and honey (D'vash - honey), to the place of the Canaanites (Kena'ani - Canaanites), Hittites (Chitti - Hittites), Amorites (Emori - Amorites), Perizzites (Perizi - Perizzites), Hivites (Chivvi - Hivites), and Jebusites (Yevusi - Jebusites)."</p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    "Now, the cry of the Israelites (Bnei - sons of Israel) has reached me, and I have also seen the oppression (Latsar - oppression) that the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians) are causing them."</p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    "So now, go, I am sending you to Pharaoh, to bring my people, the Israelites (Bnei - sons of Israel), out of Egypt."</p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    But Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) said to God (Elohim - God), "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites (Bnei - sons of Israel) out of Egypt?"</p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    God (Elohim - God) said, "I will certainly be with you, and this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God (Elohim - God) on this mountain (Har - mountain)."</p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) said to God (Elohim - God), "Suppose I go to the Israelites (Bnei - sons of Israel) and say to them, 'The God (Elohim - God) of your ancestors has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' What should I tell them?"</p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    God (Elohim - God) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "I AM WHO I AM (Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh - I AM WHO I AM). This is what you are to say to the Israelites (Bnei - sons of Israel): 'I AM has sent me to you.'"</p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    God (Elohim - God) also said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "Say to the Israelites (Bnei - sons of Israel), 'The LORD (YHWH - I AM), the God (Elohim - God) of your ancestors, the God (Elohim - God) of Abraham (Avraham - father of many), the God (Elohim - God) of Isaac (Yitzhak - laughter), and the God (Elohim - God) of Jacob (Yaakov - supplanted), has sent me to you.' This is my name forever (Olam - forever), the name you shall use for all generations (Dor - generations)."</p>

    <p><strong>16. </strong>
    "Go, assemble the elders of Israel (Yisrael - God prevails) and say to them, 'The LORD (YHWH - I AM), the God (Elohim - God) of your ancestors, the God (Elohim - God) of Abraham (Avraham - father of many), Isaac (Yitzhak - laughter), and Jacob (Yaakov - supplanted), has appeared to me and said, "I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt."'</p>

    <p><strong>17. </strong>
    "And I have promised to bring you up out of the affliction (Oneh - affliction) of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites (Kena'ani - Canaanites), Hittites (Chitti - Hittites), Amorites (Emori - Amorites), Perizzites (Perizi - Perizzites), Hivites (Chivvi - Hivites), and Jebusites (Yevusi - Jebusites), a land flowing with milk (Halav - milk) and honey (D'vash - honey)."</p>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    "The elders of Israel (Yisrael - God prevails) will listen to you, then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The LORD (YHWH - I AM), the God (Elohim - God) of the Hebrews, has met with us. Please let us go three days' journey (Derech - way) into the wilderness (Midbar - wilderness) to offer sacrifices (Zabach - sacrifice) to the LORD (YHWH - I AM) our God (Elohim - God).'</p>
