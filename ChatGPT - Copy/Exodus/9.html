    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    Behold, about this time (Ettah - time) tomorrow (Machar - tomorrow), I will cause very heavy (Chazak - heavy) hail (Barad - hail) to fall (Naphal - fall) such as has never been in Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt) from the day (Yom - day) it was founded (Yasad - founded) until now (Atah - now). </p>
