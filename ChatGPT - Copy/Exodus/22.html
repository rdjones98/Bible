    <h1>Exodus 22 - Literal Translation</h1>
    <p>1. If a man (ish - "man") steals an ox (shor - "ox") or a sheep (seh - "lamb") and kills it or sells it, he shall pay five oxen (shor - "ox") for an ox (shor - "ox") and four sheep (seh - "lambs") for a sheep (seh - "lamb").</p>

    <p>2. If a thief (ganav - "thief") is found breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there shall be no bloodguilt for him.</p>

    <p>3. But if the sun has risen on him, there shall be bloodguilt for him. He shall make full restitution. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.</p>

    <p>4. If the stolen beast (chayah - "animal") is found alive in his possession, whether it is an ox (shor - "ox") or a donkey (chamor - "donkey") or a sheep (seh - "lamb"), he shall pay double.</p>

    <p>5. If a man (ish - "man") causes a field or a vineyard (kerem - "vineyard") to be grazed over, or lets his beast (chayah - "animal") loose and it feeds in another man's (ish - "man") field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field and in the best of his own vineyard (kerem - "vineyard").</p>

    <p>6. If fire (esh - "fire") breaks out and catches in thorns, so that the stacked grain (se'orah - "barley") or the standing grain (katsir - "harvest") or the field (sadeh - "field") is consumed, he who started the fire (esh - "fire") shall make full restitution.</p>

    <p>7. If a man (ish - "man") gives to his neighbor (rea - "neighbor") money or goods to keep safe, and it is stolen from the man's house (bayit - "house"), then if the thief (ganav - "thief") is found, he shall pay double.</p>

    <p>8. If the thief (ganav - "thief") is not found, the owner of the house (bayit - "house") shall come near to God (Elohim - "God") to show whether or not he has put his hand (yad - "hand") to his neighbor's goods.</p>

    <p>9. For every breach of trust, whether it is for an ox (shor - "ox"), for a donkey (chamor - "donkey"), for a sheep (seh - "lamb"), for a cloak (simlah - "garment"), or for any lost thing about which one says, 'This is it,' the case of both parties shall come before God (Elohim - "God"). The one whom God (Elohim - "God") condemns shall pay double to his neighbor (rea - "neighbor").</p>

    <p>10. If a man (ish - "man") gives to his neighbor (rea - "neighbor") a donkey (chamor - "donkey") or an ox (shor - "ox") or a sheep (seh - "lamb") or any beast (chayah - "animal") to keep safe, and it dies or is injured or is driven away without anyone seeing it,</p>

    <p>11. an oath by the LORD (YHWH - "I AM") shall be between them both to see whether or not he has put his hand (yad - "hand") to his neighbor's goods. The owner shall accept the oath, and he shall not make restitution.</p>

    <p>12. But if it is stolen from him, he shall make restitution to its owner (ba'al - "owner").</p>

    <p>13. If it is torn by beasts (chayah - "animals"), let him bring it as evidence; he shall not make restitution for what has been torn.</p>

    <p>14. If a man (ish - "man") borrows anything of his neighbor (rea - "neighbor") and it is injured or dies, the owner (ba'al - "owner") not being with it, he shall make full restitution.</p>

    <p>15. If the owner (ba'al - "owner") was with it, he shall not make restitution. If it was hired, it came for its hire (sakar - "hire").</p>

    <p>16. If a man (ish - "man") seduces a virgin (bethulah - "virgin") who is not betrothed (me'orasah - "engaged"), and lies with her, he shall give the dowry (mohar - "bride price") for her to be his wife (ishah - "woman").</p>

    <p>17. If her father (av - "father") utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money equivalent to the dowry (mohar - "bride price") for virgins (bethulah - "virgins").</p>

    <p>18. You shall not permit a sorceress (mekhashephah - "sorceress") to live.</p>

    <p>19. Whoever lies with an animal (chayah - "animal") shall surely be put to death.</p>

    <p>20. Whoever sacrifices to any god (el - "god") other than the LORD (YHWH - "I AM") alone shall be devoted to destruction (herem - "devoted").</p>

    <p>21. You shall not wrong a sojourner (ger - "foreigner") or oppress him, for you were sojourners (ger - "foreigners") in the land of Egypt (Mitsrayim - "the narrow places").</p>

    <p>22. You shall not mistreat any widow (almanah - "widow") or fatherless child (yatom - "orphan").</p>

    <p>23. If you do mistreat them, and they cry out to me, I will surely hear their cry,</p>

    <p>24. and my wrath (aph - "anger") will burn, and I will kill you with the sword (cherev - "sword"), and your wives (ishah - "women") shall become widows (almanah - "widows") and your children (ben - "sons," bat - "daughters") fatherless (yatom - "orphaned").</p>

    <p>25. If you lend money to any of my people (am - "people"), to the poor (dal - "poor") among you, you shall not be like a moneylender (nashah - "usurer") to him, and you shall not exact interest (neshekh - "interest") from him.</p>

    <p>26. If you take your neighbor's (rea - "neighbor") cloak (simlah - "garment) as a pledge, you shall return it to him before the sun goes down,</p>

    <p>27. for that is his only covering (simlah - "garment") and it is his cloak (simlah - "garment") for his body (basar - "flesh"). In what else shall he sleep? And if he cries to me, I will hear, for I am compassionate (rachum - "merciful").</p>

    <p>28. You shall not revile God (Elohim - "God"), nor curse a ruler (nasik - "prince") of your people (am - "people").</p>

    <p>29. You shall not delay to offer from the fullness of your harvest (katsir - "harvest") and from the outflow of your presses (yatzar - "winepress"). The firstborn of your sons (ben - "sons") you shall give to me.</p>

    <p>30. You shall do the same with your ox (shor - "ox") and with your sheep (seh - "lamb"). Seven days it shall be with its mother (imah - "mother"). On the eighth day you shall give it to me.</p>

    <p>31. You shall be consecrated (kadosh - "holy") to me. Therefore you shall not eat any flesh (basar - "flesh") that is torn by beasts (chayah - "beasts") in the field. You shall throw it to the dogs (kelev - "dog").</p>
