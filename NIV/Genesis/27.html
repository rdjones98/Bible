 he called for Esau his older son
 and said to him, “My son.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-27-1">“Here I am,” he answered.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-730" class="text Gen-27-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Isaac said, “I am now an old man and don’t know the day of my death.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-731" class="text Gen-27-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Now then, get your equipment—your quiver and bow—and go out to the open country
 to hunt some wild game for me.</span> <span id="en-NIV-732" class="text Gen-27-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like
 and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing
 before I die.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-733" class="text Gen-27-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country
 to hunt game and bring it back,</span> <span id="en-NIV-734" class="text Gen-27-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Rebekah said to her son Jacob,
 “Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau,</span> <span id="en-NIV-735" class="text Gen-27-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>‘Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> before I die.’
</span> <span id="en-NIV-736" class="text Gen-27-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you:
</span> <span id="en-NIV-737" class="text Gen-27-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats,
 so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-738" class="text Gen-27-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing
 before he dies.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-739" class="text Gen-27-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “But my brother Esau is a hairy man
 while I have smooth skin.</span> <span id="en-NIV-740" class="text Gen-27-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>What if my father touches me?
 I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse
 on myself rather than a blessing.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-741" class="text Gen-27-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>His mother said to him, “My son, let the curse fall on me.
 Just do what I say;
 go and get them for me.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-742" class="text Gen-27-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-743" class="text Gen-27-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then Rebekah took the best clothes
 of Esau her older son,
 which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.</span> <span id="en-NIV-744" class="text Gen-27-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-745" class="text Gen-27-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-746" class="text Gen-27-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>He went to his father and said, “My father.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-27-18">“Yes, my son,” he answered. “Who is it?”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-747" class="text Gen-27-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn.
 I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game,
 so that you may give me your blessing.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-748" class="text Gen-27-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Isaac asked his son, “How did you find it so quickly, my son?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-27-20">“The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God gave me success,
” he replied.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-749" class="text Gen-27-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near so I can touch you,
 my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-750" class="text Gen-27-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Jacob went close to his father Isaac,
 who touched
 him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-751" class="text Gen-27-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau;
 so he proceeded to bless him.</span> <span id="en-NIV-752" class="text Gen-27-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>“Are you really my son Esau?” he asked.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-27-24">“I am,” he replied.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-753" class="text Gen-27-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Then he said, “My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing.”
</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-27-25">Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank.</span> <span id="en-NIV-754" class="text Gen-27-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come here, my son, and kiss me.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-755" class="text Gen-27-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>So he went to him and kissed
 him
. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes,
 he blessed him and said,</span></p><div class="poetry top-05"><p class="line"><span class="text Gen-27-27">“Ah, the smell of my son</span><br /><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text Gen-27-27">is like the smell of a field</span></span><br /><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text Gen-27-27">that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has blessed.

”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-761" class="text Gen-27-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>Isaac trembled violently and said, “Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me?
 I ate it just before you came and I blessed him—and indeed he will be blessed!
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-762" class="text Gen-27-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>When Esau heard his father’s words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry
 and said to his father, “Bless
 me—me too, my father!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-763" class="text Gen-27-35"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully

</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-764" class="text Gen-27-36"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>Esau said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-764a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-764a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-764a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>?
 This is the second time he has taken advantage of
 me: He took my birthright,
 and now he’s taken my blessing!”
 Then he asked, “Haven’t you reserved any blessing for me?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-765" class="text Gen-27-37"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>Isaac answered Esau, “I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine.
 So what can I possibly do for you, my son?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-766" class="text Gen-27-38"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!” Then Esau wept aloud.

”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-05"><span id="en-NIV-769" class="text Gen-27-41"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>Esau held a grudge
 against Jacob

</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-770" class="text Gen-27-42"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup>When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau

 from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living.”
