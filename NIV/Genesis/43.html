<div class='std-text'> <h3><span id="en-NIV-1292" class="text Gen-43-1">The Second Journey to Egypt</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-43-1"><span class="chapternum">43 </span>Now the famine was still severe in the land.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1293" class="text Gen-43-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt,
 their father said to them, “Go back and buy us a little more food.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1294" class="text Gen-43-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But Judah
 said to him, “The man warned us solemnly, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1295" class="text Gen-43-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>If you will send our brother along with us, we will go down and buy food for you.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1296" class="text Gen-43-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>But if you will not send him, we will not go down, because the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.
’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1297" class="text Gen-43-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Israel
 asked, “Why did you bring this trouble
 on me by telling the man you had another brother?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1298" class="text Gen-43-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>They replied, “The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. ‘Is your father still living?’
 he asked us. ‘Do you have another brother?’
 We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say, ‘Bring your brother down here’?”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1299" class="text Gen-43-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Then Judah
 said to Israel
 his father, “Send the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1300" class="text Gen-43-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him.
 If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you, I will bear the blame
 before you all my life.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1301" class="text Gen-43-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>As it is, if we had not delayed,
 we could have gone and returned twice.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1302" class="text Gen-43-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Then their father Israel
 said to them, “If it must be, then do this: Put some of the best products
 of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift
—a little balm
 and a little honey, some spices
 and myrrh,
 some pistachio nuts and almonds.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1303" class="text Gen-43-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Take double the amount
 of silver with you, for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks.
 Perhaps it was a mistake.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1304" class="text Gen-43-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Take your brother also and go back to the man at once.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1305" class="text Gen-43-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>And may God Almighty<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1305a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1305a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1305a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>
 grant you mercy
 before the man so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin come back with you.
 As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1306" class="text Gen-43-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver,
 and Benjamin also. They hurried
 down to Egypt and presented themselves
 to Joseph.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1307" class="text Gen-43-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>When Joseph saw Benjamin
 with them, he said to the steward of his house,
 “Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal and prepare a meal;
 they are to eat with me at noon.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1308" class="text Gen-43-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Joseph’s house.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1309" class="text Gen-43-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Now the men were frightened
 when they were taken to his house.
 They thought, “We were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks
 the first time. He wants to attack us
 and overpower us and seize us as slaves
 and take our donkeys.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1310" class="text Gen-43-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>So they went up to Joseph’s steward
 and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1311" class="text Gen-43-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>“We beg your pardon, our lord,” they said, “we came down here the first time to buy food.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1312" class="text Gen-43-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver—the exact weight—in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back with us.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1313" class="text Gen-43-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>We have also brought additional silver with us to buy food. We don’t know who put our silver in our sacks.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1314" class="text Gen-43-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>“It’s all right,” he said. “Don’t be afraid. Your God, the God of your father,
 has given you treasure in your sacks;
 I received your silver.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1315" class="text Gen-43-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>The steward took the men into Joseph’s house,
 gave them water to wash their feet
 and provided fodder for their donkeys.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1316" class="text Gen-43-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>They prepared their gifts
 for Joseph’s arrival at noon,
 because they had heard that they were to eat there.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1317" class="text Gen-43-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>When Joseph came home,
 they presented to him the gifts
 they had brought into the house, and they bowed down before him to the ground.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1318" class="text Gen-43-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>He asked them how they were, and then he said, “How is your aged father
 you told me about? Is he still living?”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1319" class="text Gen-43-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>They replied, “Your servant our father
 is still alive and well.” And they bowed down,
 prostrating themselves before him.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1320" class="text Gen-43-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother’s son,
 he asked, “Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?”
 And he said, “God be gracious to you,
 my son.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-1321" class="text Gen-43-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Deeply moved
 at the sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep. He went into his private room and wept
 there.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1322" class="text Gen-43-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>After he had washed his face, he came out and, controlling himself,
 said, “Serve the food.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1323" class="text Gen-43-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews,
 for that is detestable to Egyptians.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1324" class="text Gen-43-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn
 to the youngest;
 and they looked at each other in astonishment.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1325" class="text Gen-43-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>When portions were served to them from Joseph’s table, Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as anyone else’s.
 So they feasted
 and drank freely with him.</span></p> </div><div class='il-text'></div><div class="footnotes">
