 to the Negev,
 with his wife and everything he had, and Lot
 went with him.</span> <span id="en-NIV-321" class="text Gen-13-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Abram had become very wealthy
 in livestock
 and in silver and gold.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-322" class="text Gen-13-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>From the Negev
 he went from place to place until he came to Bethel,
 to the place between Bethel and Ai
 where his tent had been earlier</span> <span id="en-NIV-323" class="text Gen-13-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>and where he had first built an altar.
 There Abram called on the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-324" class="text Gen-13-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Now Lot,
 who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.</span> <span id="en-NIV-325" class="text Gen-13-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-326" class="text Gen-13-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>And quarreling
 arose between Abram’s herders and Lot’s. The Canaanites
 and Perizzites
 were also living in the land
 at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-327" class="text Gen-13-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>So Abram said to Lot,
 “Let’s not have any quarreling between you and me,
 or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-328" class="text Gen-13-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Is not the whole land before you? Let’s part company. If you go to the left, I’ll go to the right; if you go to the right, I’ll go to the left.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-329" class="text Gen-13-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain
 of the Jordan toward Zoar
 was well watered, like the garden of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,
 like the land of Egypt.
 (This was before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> destroyed Sodom
 and Gomorrah.)
</span> <span id="en-NIV-330" class="text Gen-13-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company:</span> <span id="en-NIV-331" class="text Gen-13-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Abram lived in the land of Canaan,
 while Lot
 lived among the cities of the plain
 and pitched his tents near Sodom.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-332" class="text Gen-13-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Now the people of Sodom
 were wicked and were sinning greatly against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-333" class="text Gen-13-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, “Look around from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west.

</span> <span id="en-NIV-335" class="text Gen-13-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-336" class="text Gen-13-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land,
 for I am giving it to you.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-337" class="text Gen-13-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>So Abram went to live near the great trees of Mamre
 at Hebron,
 where he pitched his tents. There he built an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.
