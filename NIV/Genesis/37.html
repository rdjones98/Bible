 the land of Canaan.
</span></p> <p class="top-05"><span id="en-NIV-1086" class="text Gen-37-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>This is the account
 of Jacob’s family line.</span></p><p class="top-05"><span class="text Gen-37-2">Joseph,
 a young man of seventeen,
 was tending the flocks
 with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah
 and the sons of Zilpah,
 his father’s wives, and he brought their father a bad report
 about them.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1087" class="text Gen-37-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Now Israel
 loved Joseph more than any of his other sons,
 because he had been born to him in his old age;
 and he made an ornate<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1087a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1087a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1087a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> robe
 for him.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1088" class="text Gen-37-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him
 and could not speak a kind word to him.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1089" class="text Gen-37-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Joseph had a dream,
 and when he told it to his brothers,
 they hated him all the more.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1090" class="text Gen-37-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had:</span> <span id="en-NIV-1091" class="text Gen-37-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>We were binding sheaves
 of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1092" class="text Gen-37-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>His brothers said to him, “Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?”
 And they hated him all the more
 because of his dream and what he had said.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1093" class="text Gen-37-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Then he had another dream,
 and he told it to his brothers. “Listen,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars
 were bowing down to me.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1094" class="text Gen-37-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>When he told his father as well as his brothers,
 his father rebuked
 him and said, “What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1095" class="text Gen-37-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>His brothers were jealous of him,
 but his father kept the matter in mind.
</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-1096" class="text Gen-37-12">Joseph Sold by His Brothers</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-37-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Now his brothers had gone to graze their father’s flocks near Shechem,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1097" class="text Gen-37-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>and Israel
 said to Joseph, “As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem.
 Come, I am going to send you to them.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-37-13">“Very well,” he replied.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1098" class="text Gen-37-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>So he said to him, “Go and see if all is well with your brothers
 and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.” Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron.
</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-37-14">When Joseph arrived at Shechem,</span> <span id="en-NIV-1099" class="text Gen-37-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, “What are you looking for?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1100" class="text Gen-37-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>He replied, “I’m looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1101" class="text Gen-37-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>“They have moved on from here,” the man answered. “I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.
’”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-37-17">So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1102" class="text Gen-37-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1103" class="text Gen-37-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>“Here comes that dreamer!
” they said to each other.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1104" class="text Gen-37-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>“Come now, let’s kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns
 and say that a ferocious animal
 devoured him.
 Then we’ll see what comes of his dreams.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1105" class="text Gen-37-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>When Reuben
 heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. “Let’s not take his life,” he said.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1106" class="text Gen-37-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>“Don’t shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern
 here in the wilderness, but don’t lay a hand on him.” Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1107" class="text Gen-37-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe—the ornate robe
 he was wearing—</span> <span id="en-NIV-1108" class="text Gen-37-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>and they took him and threw him into the cistern.
 The cistern was empty; there was no water in it.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1109" class="text Gen-37-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites
 coming from Gilead.
 Their camels were loaded with spices, balm
 and myrrh,
 and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1110" class="text Gen-37-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Judah
 said to his brothers, “What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1111" class="text Gen-37-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Come, let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother,
 our own flesh and blood.
” His brothers agreed.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1112" class="text Gen-37-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>So when the Midianite
 merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern
 and sold
 him for twenty shekels<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1112b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1112b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1112b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> of silver
 to the Ishmaelites,
 who took him to Egypt.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1113" class="text Gen-37-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1114" class="text Gen-37-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>He went back to his brothers and said, “The boy isn’t there! Where can I turn now?”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1115" class="text Gen-37-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Then they got Joseph’s robe,
 slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1116" class="text Gen-37-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>They took the ornate robe
 back to their father and said, “We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son’s robe.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1117" class="text Gen-37-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>He recognized it and said, “It is my son’s robe! Some ferocious animal
 has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1118" class="text Gen-37-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>Then Jacob tore his clothes,
 put on sackcloth
 and mourned for his son many days.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1119" class="text Gen-37-35"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>All his sons and daughters came to comfort him,
 but he refused to be comforted.
 “No,” he said, “I will continue to mourn until I join my son
 in the grave.
” So his father wept for him.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1120" class="text Gen-37-36"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>Meanwhile, the Midianites<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1120c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1120c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1120c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>
 sold Joseph
 in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard.
