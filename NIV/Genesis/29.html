<div class='std-text'> <h3><span id="en-NIV-797" class="text Gen-29-1">Jacob Arrives in Paddan Aram</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-29-1"><span class="chapternum">29 </span>Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-798" class="text Gen-29-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>There he saw a well in the open country, with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well.
 The stone
 over the mouth of the well was large.</span> <span id="en-NIV-799" class="text Gen-29-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone
 away from the well’s mouth and water the sheep.
 Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-800" class="text Gen-29-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Jacob asked the shepherds, “My brothers, where are you from?”
</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-29-4">“We’re from Harran,
” they replied.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-801" class="text Gen-29-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>He said to them, “Do you know Laban, Nahor’s grandson?”
</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-29-5">“Yes, we know him,” they answered.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-802" class="text Gen-29-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Then Jacob asked them, “Is he well?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-29-6">“Yes, he is,” they said, “and here comes his daughter Rachel
 with the sheep.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-803" class="text Gen-29-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>“Look,” he said, “the sun is still high; it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-804" class="text Gen-29-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>“We can’t,” they replied, “until all the flocks are gathered and the stone
 has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water
 the sheep.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-805" class="text Gen-29-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep,
 for she was a shepherd.</span> <span id="en-NIV-806" class="text Gen-29-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>When Jacob saw Rachel
 daughter of his uncle Laban, and Laban’s sheep, he went over and rolled the stone
 away from the mouth of the well and watered
 his uncle’s sheep.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-807" class="text Gen-29-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Then Jacob kissed
 Rachel and began to weep aloud.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-808" class="text Gen-29-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>He had told Rachel that he was a relative
 of her father and a son of Rebekah.
 So she ran and told her father.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-809" class="text Gen-29-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>As soon as Laban
 heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him
 and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things.</span> <span id="en-NIV-810" class="text Gen-29-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Then Laban said to him, “You are my own flesh and blood.”
</span></p><h3><span class="text Gen-29-14">Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-29-14">After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month,</span> <span id="en-NIV-811" class="text Gen-29-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Laban said to him, “Just because you are a relative
 of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages
 should be.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-812" class="text Gen-29-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah,
 and the name of the younger was Rachel.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-813" class="text Gen-29-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Leah had weak<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-813a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-813a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-813a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> eyes, but Rachel
 had a lovely figure and was beautiful.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-814" class="text Gen-29-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Jacob was in love with Rachel
 and said, “I’ll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-815" class="text Gen-29-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Laban said, “It’s better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-816" class="text Gen-29-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel,
 but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-817" class="text Gen-29-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to make love to her.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-818" class="text Gen-29-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-819" class="text Gen-29-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah
 and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob made love to her.</span> <span id="en-NIV-820" class="text Gen-29-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>And Laban gave his servant Zilpah
 to his daughter as her attendant.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-821" class="text Gen-29-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me?
 I served you for Rachel, didn’t I? Why have you deceived me?
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-822" class="text Gen-29-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Laban replied, “It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-823" class="text Gen-29-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Finish this daughter’s bridal week;
 then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-824" class="text Gen-29-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-825" class="text Gen-29-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Laban gave his servant Bilhah
 to his daughter Rachel as her attendant.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-826" class="text Gen-29-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Jacob made love to Rachel also, and his love for Rachel was greater than his love for Leah.
 And he worked for Laban another seven years.
</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-827" class="text Gen-29-31">Jacob’s Children</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-29-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>When the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> saw that Leah was not loved,
 he enabled her to conceive,
 but Rachel remained childless.</span> <span id="en-NIV-828" class="text Gen-29-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son.
 She named him Reuben,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-828b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-828b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-828b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>
 for she said, “It is because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has seen my misery.
 Surely my husband will love me now.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-829" class="text Gen-29-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “Because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> heard that I am not loved,
 he gave me this one too.” So she named him Simeon.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-829c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-829c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-829c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-830" class="text Gen-29-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>Again she conceived, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “Now at last my husband will become attached to me,
 because I have borne him three sons.” So he was named Levi.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-830d' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-830d&quot; title=&quot;See footnote d&quot;&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-830d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-831" class="text Gen-29-35"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “This time I will praise the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.” So she named him Judah.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-831e' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-831e&quot; title=&quot;See footnote e&quot;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-831e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup>
 Then she stopped having children.
