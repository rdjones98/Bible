 the priest of Midian
 and father-in-law of Moses, heard of everything God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, and how the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had brought Israel out of Egypt.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2002" class="text Exod-18-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah,
 his father-in-law Jethro received her</span> <span id="en-NIV-2003" class="text Exod-18-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>and her two sons.
 One son was named Gershom,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-2003a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-2003a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-2003a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> for Moses said, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land”;

 for he said, “My father’s God was my helper;
 he saved me from the sword of Pharaoh.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2005" class="text Exod-18-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, together with Moses’ sons and wife, came to him in the wilderness, where he was camped near the mountain
 of God.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2006" class="text Exod-18-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Jethro had sent word to him, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2007" class="text Exod-18-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down
 and kissed
 him. They greeted each other and then went into the tent.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2008" class="text Exod-18-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Moses told his father-in-law about everything the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake and about all the hardships
 they had met along the way and how the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had saved
 them.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2009" class="text Exod-18-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things
 the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2010" class="text Exod-18-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>He said, “Praise be to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,
 who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2011" class="text Exod-18-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Now I know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is greater than all other gods,
 for he did this to those who had treated Israel arrogantly.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2012" class="text Exod-18-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law,
 brought a burnt offering
 and other sacrifices
 to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal
 with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence
 of God.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2013" class="text Exod-18-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2014" class="text Exod-18-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he said, “What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all these people stand around you from morning till evening?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2015" class="text Exod-18-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Moses answered him, “Because the people come to me to seek God’s will.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2016" class="text Exod-18-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Whenever they have a dispute,
 it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God’s decrees and instructions.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2017" class="text Exod-18-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Moses’ father-in-law replied, “What you are doing is not good.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2018" class="text Exod-18-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2019" class="text Exod-18-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Listen now to me and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you.
 You must be the people’s representative before God and bring their disputes
 to him.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2020" class="text Exod-18-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Teach them his decrees and instructions,
 and show them the way they are to live
 and how they are to behave.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2021" class="text Exod-18-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>But select capable men
 from all the people—men who fear
 God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain
—and appoint them as officials
 over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2022" class="text Exod-18-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case
 to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share
 it with you.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2023" class="text Exod-18-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2024" class="text Exod-18-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2025" class="text Exod-18-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders
 of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2026" class="text Exod-18-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>They served as judges
 for the people at all times. The difficult cases
 they brought to Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2027" class="text Exod-18-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro returned to his own country.
