<div class='std-text'> <h3><span id="en-NIV-2028" class="text Exod-19-1">At Mount Sinai</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Exod-19-1"><span class="chapternum">19 </span>On the first day of the third month after the Israelites left Egypt
—on that very day—they came to the Desert of Sinai.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2029" class="text Exod-19-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>After they set out from Rephidim,
 they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2030" class="text Exod-19-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Then Moses went up to God,
 and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> called
 to him from the mountain and said, “This is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel:</span> <span id="en-NIV-2031" class="text Exod-19-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>‘You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt,
 and how I carried you on eagles’ wings
 and brought you to myself.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2032" class="text Exod-19-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Now if you obey me fully
 and keep my covenant,
 then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession.
 Although the whole earth
 is mine,</span> <span id="en-NIV-2033" class="text Exod-19-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>you<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-2033a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-2033a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-2033a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> will be for me a kingdom of priests
 and a holy nation.’
 These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2034" class="text Exod-19-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>So Moses went back and summoned the elders
 of the people and set before them all the words the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded him to speak.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2035" class="text Exod-19-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The people all responded together, “We will do everything the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has said.”
 So Moses brought their answer back to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2036" class="text Exod-19-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud,
 so that the people will hear me speaking
 with you and will always put their trust
 in you.” Then Moses told the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> what the people had said.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2037" class="text Exod-19-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate
 them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2038" class="text Exod-19-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>and be ready by the third day,
 because on that day the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will come down
 on Mount Sinai
 in the sight of all the people.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2039" class="text Exod-19-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Put limits
 for the people around the mountain and tell them, ‘Be careful that you do not approach the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain is to be put to death.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2040" class="text Exod-19-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>They are to be stoned
 or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on them. No person or animal shall be permitted to live.’ Only when the ram’s horn
 sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2041" class="text Exod-19-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2042" class="text Exod-19-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then he said to the people, “Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain
 from sexual relations.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2043" class="text Exod-19-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>On the morning of the third day there was thunder
 and lightning, with a thick cloud
 over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast.
 Everyone in the camp trembled.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2044" class="text Exod-19-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2045" class="text Exod-19-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Mount Sinai was covered with smoke,
 because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> descended on it in fire.
 The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace,
 and the whole mountain<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-2045b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-2045b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-2045b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> trembled
 violently.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2046" class="text Exod-19-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and the voice
 of God answered
 him.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-2046c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-2046c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-2046c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2047" class="text Exod-19-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> descended to the top of Mount Sinai

 the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and many of them perish.

 the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, must consecrate
