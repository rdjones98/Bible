 the first month of your year.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1820" class="text Exod-12-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1820a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1820a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1820a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>

</span> <span id="en-NIV-1821" class="text Exod-12-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1822" class="text Exod-12-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect,
 and you may take them from the sheep or the goats.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1823" class="text Exod-12-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month,
 when all the members of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1824" class="text Exod-12-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then they are to take some of the blood
 and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1825" class="text Exod-12-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>That same night
 they are to eat the meat roasted
 over the fire, along with bitter herbs,
 and bread made without yeast.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1826" class="text Exod-12-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Do not eat the meat raw or boiled in water, but roast it over a fire—with the head, legs and internal organs.

 if some is left till morning, you must burn it.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1828" class="text Exod-12-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste;
 it is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s Passover.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1829" class="text Exod-12-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>“On that same night I will pass through
 Egypt and strike down
 every firstborn

</span> <span id="en-NIV-1830" class="text Exod-12-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood, I will pass over
 you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.

 lamb.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1839" class="text Exod-12-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Take a bunch of hyssop,

 down the Egyptians, he will see the blood
 on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over
 that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer

 that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1843" class="text Exod-12-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>And when your children
 ask you, ‘What does this ceremony mean to you?’</span> <span id="en-NIV-1844" class="text Exod-12-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>then tell them, ‘It is the Passover
 sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.’”
 Then the people bowed down and worshiped.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1845" class="text Exod-12-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>The Israelites did just what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded
 Moses and Aaron.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1846" class="text Exod-12-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>At midnight
 the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>
 struck down all the firstborn
 in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock
 as well.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1847" class="text Exod-12-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing

 me.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1850" class="text Exod-12-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>The Egyptians urged the people to hurry
 and leave
 the country. “For otherwise,” they said, “we will all die!”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1851" class="text Exod-12-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs
 wrapped in clothing.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1852" class="text Exod-12-35"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold

 of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1857" class="text Exod-12-40"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1857b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1857b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1857b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> was 430 years.

 left Egypt.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1859" class="text Exod-12-42"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup>Because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> for the generations to come.
