<div class='std-text'> <h3><span id="en-NIV-1634" class="text Exod-5-1">Bricks Without Straw</span></h3><p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Exod-5-1"><span class="chapternum">5 </span>Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘Let my people go,
 so that they may hold a festival
 to me in the wilderness.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1635" class="text Exod-5-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Pharaoh said, “Who is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,
 that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and I will not let Israel go.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1636" class="text Exod-5-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey
 into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God, or he may strike us with plagues
 or with the sword.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1637" class="text Exod-5-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But the king of Egypt said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor?
 Get back to your work!”</span> <span id="en-NIV-1638" class="text Exod-5-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous,
 and you are stopping them from working.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1639" class="text Exod-5-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers
 and overseers in charge of the people:</span> <span id="en-NIV-1640" class="text Exod-5-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>“You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks;
 let them go and gather their own straw.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1641" class="text Exod-5-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don’t reduce the quota.
 They are lazy;
 that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1642" class="text Exod-5-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1643" class="text Exod-5-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Then the slave drivers
 and the overseers went out and said to the people, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you any more straw.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1644" class="text Exod-5-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced
 at all.’”</span> <span id="en-NIV-1645" class="text Exod-5-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1646" class="text Exod-5-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, “Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-1647" class="text Exod-5-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>And Pharaoh’s slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed,
 demanding, “Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1648" class="text Exod-5-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why have you treated your servants this way?</span> <span id="en-NIV-1649" class="text Exod-5-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1650" class="text Exod-5-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Pharaoh said, “Lazy, that’s what you are—lazy!
 That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’</span> <span id="en-NIV-1651" class="text Exod-5-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Now get to work.
 You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1652" class="text Exod-5-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-1653" class="text Exod-5-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,</span> <span id="en-NIV-1654" class="text Exod-5-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>and they said, “May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> look on you and judge
 you! You have made us obnoxious
 to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword
 in their hand to kill us.”
</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-1655" class="text Exod-5-22">God Promises Deliverance</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-5-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Moses returned to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and said, “Why, Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people?
 Is this why you sent me?</span> <span id="en-NIV-1656" class="text Exod-5-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued
 your people at all.”</span></p> </div><div class='il-text'></div><div class="crossrefs hidden">
