 they gathered around Aaron and said, “Come, make us gods<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-2440a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-2440a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-2440a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> who will go before
 us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2441" class="text Exod-32-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Aaron answered them, “Take off the gold earrings
 that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-2442" class="text Exod-32-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2443" class="text Exod-32-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>He took what they handed him and made it into an idol
 cast in the shape of a calf,
 fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, “These are your gods,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-2443b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-2443b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-2443b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>
 Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2444" class="text Exod-32-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, “Tomorrow there will be a festival
 to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-2445" class="text Exod-32-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings.
 Afterward they sat down to eat and drink
 and got up to indulge in revelry.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2446" class="text Exod-32-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt,
 have become corrupt.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2447" class="text Exod-32-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>They have been quick to turn away
 from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol
 cast in the shape of a calf.
 They have bowed down to it and sacrificed
 to it and have said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.’
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2448" class="text Exod-32-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>“I have seen these people,” the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “and they are a stiff-necked
 people.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2449" class="text Exod-32-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Now leave me alone
 so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy
 them. Then I will make you into a great nation.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2450" class="text Exod-32-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>But Moses sought the favor
 of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> his God. “<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,” he said, “why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2451" class="text Exod-32-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth’?
 Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster
 on your people.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2452" class="text Exod-32-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Remember
 your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self:
 ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars
 in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land
 I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.’”</span> <span id="en-NIV-2453" class="text Exod-32-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> relented
 and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2454" class="text Exod-32-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant law
 in his hands.
 They were inscribed
 on both sides, front and back.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2455" class="text Exod-32-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2456" class="text Exod-32-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>When Joshua
 heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, “There is the sound of war in the camp.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2457" class="text Exod-32-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Moses replied:</span></p><div class="poetry top-05"><p class="line"><span class="text Exod-32-18">“It is not the sound of victory,</span><br /><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text Exod-32-18">it is not the sound of defeat;</span></span><br /><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text Exod-32-18">it is the sound of singing that I hear.”</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-05"><span id="en-NIV-2458" class="text Exod-32-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf
 and the dancing,
 his anger burned
 and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces
 at the foot of the mountain.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2459" class="text Exod-32-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>And he took the calf the people had made and burned
 it in the fire; then he ground it to powder,
 scattered it on the water
 and made the Israelites drink it.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2460" class="text Exod-32-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>He said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2461" class="text Exod-32-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>“Do not be angry,
 my lord,” Aaron answered. “You know how prone these people are to evil.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2462" class="text Exod-32-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>They said to me, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.’
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2463" class="text Exod-32-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>So I told them, ‘Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.’ Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2464" class="text Exod-32-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock
 to their enemies.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2465" class="text Exod-32-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, come to me.” And all the Levites rallied to him.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2466" class="text Exod-32-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Then he said to them, “This is what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.’”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2467" class="text Exod-32-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2468" class="text Exod-32-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Then Moses said, “You have been set apart to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2469" class="text Exod-32-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin.
 But now I will go up to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; perhaps I can make atonement
 for your sin.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2470" class="text Exod-32-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>So Moses went back to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and said, “Oh, what a great sin these people have committed!
 They have made themselves gods of gold.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2471" class="text Exod-32-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>But now, please forgive their sin
—but if not, then blot me
 out of the book
 you have written.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2472" class="text Exod-32-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> replied to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out
 of my book.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2473" class="text Exod-32-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>Now go, lead
 the people to the place
 I spoke of, and my angel
 will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish,
 I will punish them for their sin.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2474" class="text Exod-32-35"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf
 Aaron had made.</span></p> </div><div class='il-text'></div><div class="footnotes">
