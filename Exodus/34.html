 Present yourself to me there on top of the mountain.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2500" class="text Exod-34-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain;
 not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2501" class="text Exod-34-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>So Moses chiseled
 out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded him; and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2502" class="text Exod-34-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came down in the cloud
