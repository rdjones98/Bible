 who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:</span> <span id="en-NIV-1535" class="text Exod-1-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;</span> <span id="en-NIV-1536" class="text Exod-1-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;</span> <span id="en-NIV-1537" class="text Exod-1-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1538" class="text Exod-1-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1538a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1538a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1538a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> in all;
 Joseph was already in Egypt.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1539" class="text Exod-1-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1540" class="text Exod-1-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers
 and became so numerous that the land was filled with them.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1541" class="text Exod-1-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1542" class="text Exod-1-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>“Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous
 for us.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1543" class="text Exod-1-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Come, we must deal shrewdly
 with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1544" class="text Exod-1-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>So they put slave masters
 over them to oppress them with forced labor,
 and they built Pithom and Rameses
 as store cities
 for Pharaoh.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1545" class="text Exod-1-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites</span> <span id="en-NIV-1546" class="text Exod-1-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>and worked them ruthlessly.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1547" class="text Exod-1-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>They made their lives bitter with harsh labor
 in brick
 and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labor the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1548" class="text Exod-1-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives,
 whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,</span> <span id="en-NIV-1549" class="text Exod-1-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>“When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1550" class="text Exod-1-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>The midwives, however, feared
 God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do;
 they let the boys live.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1551" class="text Exod-1-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1552" class="text Exod-1-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1553" class="text Exod-1-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>So God was kind to the midwives
 and the people increased and became even more numerous.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1554" class="text Exod-1-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>And because the midwives feared
 God, he gave them families
 of their own.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1555" class="text Exod-1-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile,
 but let every girl live.”
