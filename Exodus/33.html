<div class='std-text'> <p class="chapter-2"><span id="en-NIV-2475" class="text Exod-33-1"><span class="chapternum">33 </span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of Egypt, and go up to the land I promised on oath
 to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2476" class="text Exod-33-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>I will send an angel
 before you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2477" class="text Exod-33-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey.
 But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked
 people and I might destroy
 you on the way.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2478" class="text Exod-33-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn
 and no one put on any ornaments.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2479" class="text Exod-33-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You are a stiff-necked people.
 If I were to go with you even for a moment, I might destroy
 you. Now take off your ornaments and I will decide what to do with you.’”</span> <span id="en-NIV-2480" class="text Exod-33-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments at Mount Horeb.
</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-2481" class="text Exod-33-7">The Tent of Meeting</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-33-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the “tent of meeting.”
 Anyone inquiring
 of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2482" class="text Exod-33-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>And whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents,
 watching Moses until he entered the tent.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2483" class="text Exod-33-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>As Moses went into the tent, the pillar of cloud
 would come down and stay at the entrance, while the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke
 with Moses.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2484" class="text Exod-33-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at the entrance to their tent.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2485" class="text Exod-33-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> would speak to Moses face to face,
 as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua
 son of Nun did not leave the tent.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-2486" class="text Exod-33-12">Moses and the Glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span></span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-33-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Moses said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “You have been telling me, ‘Lead these people,’
 but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. You have said, ‘I know you by name
 and you have found favor
 with me.’</span> <span id="en-NIV-2487" class="text Exod-33-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways
 so I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2488" class="text Exod-33-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> replied, “My Presence
 will go with you, and I will give you rest.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2489" class="text Exod-33-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then Moses said to him, “If your Presence
 does not go with us, do not send us up from here.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2490" class="text Exod-33-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us?
 What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2491" class="text Exod-33-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “I will do the very thing you have asked,
 because I am pleased with you and I know you by name.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2492" class="text Exod-33-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Then Moses said, “Now show me your glory.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2493" class="text Exod-33-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “I will cause all my goodness to pass
 in front of you, and I will proclaim my name,
 the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2494" class="text Exod-33-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for no one may see
 me and live.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2495" class="text Exod-33-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2496" class="text Exod-33-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock
 and cover you with my hand
 until I have passed by.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2497" class="text Exod-33-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen.”</span></p> </div><div class='il-text'></div><div class="crossrefs hidden">
