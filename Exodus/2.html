 married a Levite woman,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1557" class="text Exod-2-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine
 child, she hid him for three months.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1558" class="text Exod-2-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus
 basket<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1558a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1558a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1558a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> for him and coated it with tar and pitch.
 Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds
 along the bank of the Nile.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1559" class="text Exod-2-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>His sister
 stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1560" class="text Exod-2-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank.
 She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1561" class="text Exod-2-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” she said.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1562" class="text Exod-2-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1563" class="text Exod-2-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>“Yes, go,” she answered. So the girl went and got the baby’s mother.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1564" class="text Exod-2-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So the woman took the baby and nursed him.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1565" class="text Exod-2-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son.

 him Moses,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1565b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1565b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1565b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> saying, “I drew

 were and watched them at their hard labor.
 He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1567" class="text Exod-2-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Looking this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1568" class="text Exod-2-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1569" class="text Exod-2-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The man said, “Who made you ruler and judge over us?
 Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and thought, “What I did must have become known.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1570" class="text Exod-2-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill
 Moses, but Moses fled
 from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian,
 where he sat down by a well.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1571" class="text Exod-2-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Now a priest of Midian
 had seven daughters, and they came to draw water
 and fill the troughs
 to water their father’s flock.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1572" class="text Exod-2-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue
 and watered their flock.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1573" class="text Exod-2-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>When the girls returned to Reuel
 their father, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1574" class="text Exod-2-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1575" class="text Exod-2-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>“And where is he?” Reuel asked his daughters. “Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1576" class="text Exod-2-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah
 to Moses in marriage.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1577" class="text Exod-2-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1577c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1577c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1577c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>

 in a foreign land.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1578" class="text Exod-2-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>During that long period,
 the king of Egypt died.
 The Israelites groaned in their slavery
 and cried out, and their cry
 for help because of their slavery went up to God.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1579" class="text Exod-2-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>God heard their groaning and he remembered
 his covenant
 with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1580" class="text Exod-2-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned
 about them.</span></p> </div><div class='il-text'></div><div class="footnotes">
