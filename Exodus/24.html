<div class='std-text'> <h3><span id="en-NIV-2179" class="text Exod-24-1">The Covenant Confirmed</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Exod-24-1"><span class="chapternum">24 </span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Come up to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, you and Aaron,
 Nadab and Abihu,
 and seventy of the elders
 of Israel. You are to worship at a distance,</span> <span id="en-NIV-2180" class="text Exod-24-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>but Moses alone is to approach
 the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; the others must not come near. And the people may not come up with him.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2181" class="text Exod-24-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>When Moses went and told the people all the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s words and laws,
 they responded with one voice, “Everything the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has said we will do.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2182" class="text Exod-24-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Moses then wrote
 down everything the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said.</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-24-4">He got up early the next morning and built an altar
 at the foot of the mountain and set up twelve stone pillars
 representing the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2183" class="text Exod-24-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then he sent young Israelite men, and they offered burnt offerings
 and sacrificed young bulls as fellowship offerings
 to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2184" class="text Exod-24-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Moses
 took half of the blood
 and put it in bowls, and the other half he splashed
 against the altar.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2185" class="text Exod-24-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then he took the Book of the Covenant
 and read it to the people. They responded, “We will do everything the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has said; we will obey.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2186" class="text Exod-24-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Moses then took the blood, sprinkled it on the people
 and said, “This is the blood of the covenant
 that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has made with you in accordance with all these words.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2187" class="text Exod-24-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders
 of Israel went up</span> <span id="en-NIV-2188" class="text Exod-24-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>and saw
 the God of Israel. Under his feet was something like a pavement made of lapis lazuli,
 as bright blue as the sky.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2189" class="text Exod-24-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>But God did not raise his hand against these leaders of the Israelites; they saw
 God, and they ate and drank.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2190" class="text Exod-24-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain and stay here, and I will give you the tablets of stone
 with the law and commandments I have written for their instruction.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2191" class="text Exod-24-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Then Moses set out with Joshua
 his aide, and Moses went up on the mountain
 of God.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2192" class="text Exod-24-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>He said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we come back to you. Aaron and Hur
 are with you, and anyone involved in a dispute
 can go to them.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-2193" class="text Exod-24-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>When Moses went up on the mountain, the cloud
 covered it,</span> <span id="en-NIV-2194" class="text Exod-24-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>and the glory
 of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> settled on Mount Sinai.
 For six days the cloud covered the mountain, and on the seventh day the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> called to Moses from within the cloud.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2195" class="text Exod-24-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>To the Israelites the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> looked like a consuming fire
 on top of the mountain.</span> <span id="en-NIV-2196" class="text Exod-24-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Then Moses entered the cloud as he went on up the mountain. And he stayed on the mountain forty
 days and forty nights.
