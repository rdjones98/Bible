<div class='std-text'> <h3><span id="en-NIV-1949" class="text Exod-16-1">Manna and Quail</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Exod-16-1"><span class="chapternum">16 </span>The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin,
 which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1950" class="text Exod-16-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>In the desert the whole community grumbled
 against Moses and Aaron.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1951" class="text Exod-16-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s hand in Egypt!
 There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food
 we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1952" class="text Exod-16-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “I will rain down bread from heaven
 for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test
 them and see whether they will follow my instructions.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1953" class="text Exod-16-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice
 as much as they gather on the other days.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1954" class="text Exod-16-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you will know that it was the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> who brought you out of Egypt,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1955" class="text Exod-16-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>and in the morning you will see the glory
 of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, because he has heard your grumbling
 against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1956" class="text Exod-16-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Moses also said, “You will know that it was the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling
 against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1957" class="text Exod-16-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Then Moses told Aaron, “Say to the entire Israelite community, ‘Come before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, for he has heard your grumbling.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1958" class="text Exod-16-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory
 of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appearing in the cloud.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1959" class="text Exod-16-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses,</span> <span id="en-NIV-1960" class="text Exod-16-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>“I have heard the grumbling
 of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.’”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1961" class="text Exod-16-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>That evening quail
 came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew
 around the camp.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1962" class="text Exod-16-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost
 on the ground appeared on the desert floor.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1963" class="text Exod-16-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, “What is it?” For they did not know
 what it was.</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-16-15">Moses said to them, “It is the bread
 the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has given you to eat.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1964" class="text Exod-16-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>This is what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has commanded: ‘Everyone is to gather as much as they need.

 for each person you have in your tent.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1965" class="text Exod-16-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1966" class="text Exod-16-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>And when they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.
 Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1967" class="text Exod-16-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Then Moses said to them, “No one is to keep any of it until morning.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1968" class="text Exod-16-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell.
 So Moses was angry
 with them.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1969" class="text Exod-16-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1970" class="text Exod-16-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>On the sixth day, they gathered twice
 as much—two omers<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1970b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1970b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1970b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> for each person—and the leaders of the community
 came and reported this to Moses.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1971" class="text Exod-16-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>He said to them, “This is what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded: ‘Tomorrow is to be a day of sabbath rest, a holy sabbath
 to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1972" class="text Exod-16-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1973" class="text Exod-16-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>“Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a sabbath to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. You will not find any of it on the ground today.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1974" class="text Exod-16-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath,
 there will not be any.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1975" class="text Exod-16-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1976" class="text Exod-16-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “How long will you<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1976c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1976c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1976c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> refuse to keep my commands
 and my instructions?</span> <span id="en-NIV-1977" class="text Exod-16-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Bear in mind that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where they are on the seventh day; no one is to go out.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-1978" class="text Exod-16-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>So the people rested on the seventh day.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1979" class="text Exod-16-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>The people of Israel called the bread manna.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1979d' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1979d&quot; title=&quot;See footnote d&quot;&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1979d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>
 It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1980" class="text Exod-16-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Moses said, “This is what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has commanded: ‘Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I brought you out of Egypt.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1981" class="text Exod-16-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>So Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put an omer of manna
 in it. Then place it before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to be kept for the generations to come.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1982" class="text Exod-16-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna with the tablets of the covenant law,
 so that it might be preserved.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1983" class="text Exod-16-35"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>The Israelites ate manna
 forty years,
 until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan.

 is one-tenth of an ephah.)
