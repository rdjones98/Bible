After that, he will let you go
 from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1809" class="text Exod-11-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1810" class="text Exod-11-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>(The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> made the Egyptians favorably disposed
 toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded
 in Egypt by Pharaoh’s officials and by the people.)</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1811" class="text Exod-11-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>So Moses said, “This is what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> says: ‘About midnight
