<div class='std-text'> <h3><span id="en-NIV-1779" class="text Exod-10-1">The Plague of Locusts</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Exod-10-1"><span class="chapternum">10 </span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart
 and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these signs
 of mine among them</span> <span id="en-NIV-1780" class="text Exod-10-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>that you may tell your children
 and grandchildren how I dealt harshly
 with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1781" class="text Exod-10-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “This is what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How long will you refuse to humble
 yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1782" class="text Exod-10-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>If you refuse
 to let them go, I will bring locusts
 into your country tomorrow.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1783" class="text Exod-10-5">

 <sup class="versenum">5 </sup>They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left
 after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1784" class="text Exod-10-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>They will fill your houses
 and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians—something neither your parents nor your ancestors have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.’”
 Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1785" class="text Exod-10-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Pharaoh’s officials said to him, “How long will this man be a snare
 to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1786" class="text Exod-10-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship
 the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God,” he said. “But tell me who will be going.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1787" class="text Exod-10-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Moses answered, “We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival
 to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1788" class="text Exod-10-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Pharaoh said, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> be with you—if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1788a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1788a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1788a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span> <span id="en-NIV-1789" class="text Exod-10-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>No! Have only the men go and worship the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, since that’s what you have been asking for.” Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh’s presence.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1790" class="text Exod-10-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand
 over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1791" class="text Exod-10-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>So Moses stretched out his staff
 over Egypt, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts;
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1792" class="text Exod-10-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts,
 nor will there ever be again.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1793" class="text Exod-10-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured
 all that was left after the hail—everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1794" class="text Exod-10-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Pharaoh quickly summoned
 Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned
 against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God and against you.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1795" class="text Exod-10-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Now forgive
 my sin once more and pray
 to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God to take this deadly plague away from me.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1796" class="text Exod-10-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1797" class="text Exod-10-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1797b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1797b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1797b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1798" class="text Exod-10-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> hardened Pharaoh’s heart,

 spreads over Egypt—darkness that can be felt.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-1800" class="text Exod-10-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness
 covered all Egypt for three days.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1801" class="text Exod-10-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1802" class="text Exod-10-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go,
 worship the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Even your women and children
 may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1803" class="text Exod-10-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>But Moses said, “You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings

 and he was not willing to let them go.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1806" class="text Exod-10-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Pharaoh said to Moses, “Get out of my sight!

The day you see my face you will die.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1807" class="text Exod-10-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>“Just as you say,” Moses replied. “I will never appear
