said to Moses,</span> <span id="en-NIV-1892" class="text Exod-14-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>“Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol
 and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1893" class="text Exod-14-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Pharaoh will think, ‘The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.’</span> 
<span id="en-NIV-1894" class="text Exod-14-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart,
 and he will pursue them.
 But I will gain glory
 for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> [Ani YHWH].”
 So the Israelites did this.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1895" class="text Exod-14-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled,
 Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds
 about them and said, “What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!”</span> <span id="en-NIV-1896" class="text Exod-14-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1897" class="text Exod-14-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>He took six hundred of the best chariots,
 along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1898" class="text Exod-14-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> hardened the heart
 of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1899" class="text Exod-14-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>The Egyptians—all Pharaoh’s horses
 and chariots, horsemen<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1899a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1899a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1899a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> and troops
—pursued the Israelites and overtook
 them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1900" class="text Exod-14-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried
 out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1901" class="text Exod-14-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die?
 What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?</span> <span id="en-NIV-1902" class="text Exod-14-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Didn’t we say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians’?

</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1903" class="text Exod-14-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Moses answered the people, “Do not be afraid.
 Stand firm and you will see
 the deliverance the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see
 again.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1904" class="text Exod-14-14">
 <sup class="versenum">14 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will fight
 for you; you need only to be still.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1905" class="text Exod-14-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to me?
 Tell the Israelites to move on.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1906" class="text Exod-14-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Raise your staff
 and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water
 so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1907" class="text Exod-14-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>I will harden the hearts

 who had been traveling in front of Israel’s army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud
 also moved from in front and stood behind
 them,</span> <span id="en-NIV-1910" class="text Exod-14-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness
 to the one side and light to the other side; so neither went near the other all night long.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1911" class="text Exod-14-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Then Moses stretched out his hand
 over the sea,
 and all that night the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> drove the sea back with a strong east wind
 and turned it into dry land.
 The waters were divided,

 on dry ground,
 with a wall
