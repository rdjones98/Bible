 his father-in-law, the priest of Midian,
 and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb,
 the mountain
 of God.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1582" class="text Exod-3-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>There the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>
 appeared to him in flames of fire
 from within a bush.
 Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1583" class="text Exod-3-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>So Moses thought, “I will go over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1584" class="text Exod-3-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>When the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> saw that he had gone over to look, God called
 to him from within the bush,
 “Moses! Moses!”</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-3-4">And Moses said, “Here I am.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1585" class="text Exod-3-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>“Do not come any closer,”
 God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1586" class="text Exod-3-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Then he said, “I am the God of your father,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1586a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1586a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1586a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.”
 At this, Moses hid
 his face, because he was afraid to look at God.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1587" class="text Exod-3-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “I have indeed seen
 the misery
 of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned
 about their suffering.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1588" class="text Exod-3-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>So I have come down
 to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land,
 a land flowing with milk and honey
—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites
 and Jebusites.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1589" class="text Exod-3-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing
 them.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1590" class="text Exod-3-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>So now, go. I am sending
 you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1591" class="text Exod-3-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>But Moses said to God, “Who am I
 that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1592" class="text Exod-3-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>And God said, “I will be with you.
