 to me and say, ‘The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> did not appear to you’?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1604" class="text Exod-4-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “What is that in your hand?”</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-4-2">“A staff,”
 he replied.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1605" class="text Exod-4-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Throw it on the ground.”</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-4-3">Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake,
 and he ran from it.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1606" class="text Exod-4-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “Reach out your hand and take it by the tail.” So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1607" class="text Exod-4-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>“This,” said the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “is so that they may believe
 that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has appeared to you.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1608" class="text Exod-4-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, the skin was leprous<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1608a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1608a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1608a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>—it had become as white as snow.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1609" class="text Exod-4-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>“Now put it back into your cloak,” he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored,
 like the rest of his flesh.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1610" class="text Exod-4-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “If they do not believe
 you or pay attention to the first sign,
 they may believe the second.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1611" class="text Exod-4-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood
 on the ground.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1612" class="text Exod-4-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Moses said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Pardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1613" class="text Exod-4-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “Who gave human beings their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute?
 Who gives them sight or makes them blind?
 Is it not I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>?</span> <span id="en-NIV-1614" class="text Exod-4-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Now go;
 I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1615" class="text Exod-4-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>But Moses said, “Pardon your servant, Lord. Please send someone else.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1616" class="text Exod-4-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s anger burned
 against Moses and he said, “What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet
 you, and he will be glad to see you.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1617" class="text Exod-4-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth;
 I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1618" class="text Exod-4-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth
 and as if you were God to him.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1619" class="text Exod-4-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>But take this staff
 in your hand
 so you can perform the signs
 with it.”</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-1620" class="text Exod-4-18">Moses Returns to Egypt</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-4-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Let me return to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive.”</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-4-18">Jethro said, “Go, and I wish you well.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1621" class="text Exod-4-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill
 you are dead.
”</span> <span id="en-NIV-1622" class="text Exod-4-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>So Moses took his wife and sons,
 put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff
 of God in his hand.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1623" class="text Exod-4-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders
 I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart
 so that he will not let the people go.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1624" class="text Exod-4-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Then say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> says: Israel is my firstborn son,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1625" class="text Exod-4-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>and I told you, “Let my son go,
 so he may worship
 me.” But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.’”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1626" class="text Exod-4-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>At a lodging place on the way, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> met Moses<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1626b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1626b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1626b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> and was about to kill
 him.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1627" class="text Exod-4-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>But Zipporah
 took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin
 and touched Moses’ feet with it.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1627c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1627c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1627c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me,” she said.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1628" class="text Exod-4-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> let him alone. (At that time she said “bridegroom of blood,” referring to circumcision.)</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1629" class="text Exod-4-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he met Moses at the mountain
 of God and kissed
 him.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1630" class="text Exod-4-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Then Moses told Aaron everything the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had sent him to say, and also about all the signs he had commanded him to perform.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1631" class="text Exod-4-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders
 of the Israelites,</span> <span id="en-NIV-1632" class="text Exod-4-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>and Aaron told them everything the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said to Moses. He also performed the signs
 before the people,</span> <span id="en-NIV-1633" class="text Exod-4-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>and they believed.
 And when they heard that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was concerned
 about them and had seen their misery,
 they bowed down and worshiped.
