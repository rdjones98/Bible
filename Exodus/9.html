 could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the Egyptians.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1755" class="text Exod-9-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> hardened Pharaoh’s heart

 <p><span id="en-NIV-1763" class="text Exod-9-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Those officials of Pharaoh who feared
 the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1764" class="text Exod-9-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>But those who ignored
 the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> left their slaves and livestock in the field.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1765" class="text Exod-9-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt—on people and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-1766" class="text Exod-9-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent thunder
 and hail,
 and lightning flashed down to the ground.

</span> <span id="en-NIV-1768" class="text Exod-9-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields—both people and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1769" class="text Exod-9-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen,
 where the Israelites were.

 is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1773" class="text Exod-9-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>But I know that you and your officials still do not fear
 the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1774" class="text Exod-9-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>(The flax and barley

 however, were not destroyed, because they ripen later.)</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1776" class="text Exod-9-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city.

 was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said through Moses.</span></p> </div><div class='il-text'></div><div class="footnotes">
