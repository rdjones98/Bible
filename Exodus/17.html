 traveling from place to place as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded. They camped at Rephidim,
 but there was no water
 for the people to drink.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1986" class="text Exod-17-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>So they quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water
 to drink.”
</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-17-2">Moses replied, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to the test?”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1987" class="text Exod-17-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But the people were thirsty
 for water there, and they grumbled
 against Moses. They said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die
 of thirst?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1988" class="text Exod-17-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Then Moses cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “What am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone
 me.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1989" class="text Exod-17-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> answered Moses, “Go out in front of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff
 with which you struck the Nile,
 and go.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1990" class="text Exod-17-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb.
 Strike
 the rock, and water
 will come out of it for the people to drink.” So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1991" class="text Exod-17-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>And he called the place Massah<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1991a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1991a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1991a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>

 because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> saying, “Is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> among us or not?”</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-1992" class="text Exod-17-8">The Amalekites Defeated</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-17-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The Amalekites
 came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.

 “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff
 of God in my hands.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1994" class="text Exod-17-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur
 went to the top of the hill.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1995" class="text Exod-17-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning,
 but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1996" class="text Exod-17-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>When Moses’ hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up—one on one side, one on the other—so that his hands remained steady till sunset.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1997" class="text Exod-17-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>So Joshua overcame the Amalekite
 army with the sword.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1998" class="text Exod-17-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Write
