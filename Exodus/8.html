 The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1725" class="text Exod-8-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1726" class="text Exod-8-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief,
 he hardened his heart
 and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-1727" class="text Exod-8-16">The Plague of Gnats</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-8-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff

 Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1737" class="text Exod-8-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>But Moses said, “That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God would be detestable to the Egyptians.
 And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone us?</span> <span id="en-NIV-1738" class="text Exod-8-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>We must take a three-day journey
 into the wilderness to offer sacrifices

Now pray
 for me.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1740" class="text Exod-8-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Moses answered, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Only let Pharaoh be sure that he does not act deceitfully
 again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1741" class="text Exod-8-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1742" class="text Exod-8-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> did what Moses asked.
