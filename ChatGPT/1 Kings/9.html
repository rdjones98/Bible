    <h1>1 Kings 9 - Modern English Translation</h1>

    <p><strong>1</strong> When Solomon (Shlomo – Peace) had finished building the house of the LORD (YHWH – He is), and the king's house, and all that Solomon desired to build,</p>

    <p><strong>2</strong> the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon (Giv'on – Hill City).</p>

    <p><strong>3</strong> And the LORD said to him, “I have heard your prayer and your plea, which you have made before me. I have consecrated this house that you have built, to put my name there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there for all time.</p>

    <p><strong>4</strong> And as for you, if you will walk before me, as David (David – Beloved) your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my rules,</p>

    <p><strong>5</strong> then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’</p>

    <p><strong>6</strong> But if you turn aside from following me, you or your children, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have set before you, but go and serve other gods (elohim – mighty ones) and worship them,</p>

    <p><strong>7</strong> then I will cut off Israel (Yisra’el – God strives) from the land that I have given them, and the house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight, and Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples.</p>

    <p><strong>8</strong> And this house will become a heap of ruins. Everyone passing by it will be astonished and hiss, and they will say, ‘Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?’</p>

    <p><strong>9</strong> Then they will say, ‘Because they abandoned the LORD their God (Eloheihem – their Mighty One), who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt (Mitzrayim – Narrow Place), and laid hold on other gods (elohim – mighty ones) and worshiped them and served them. Therefore the LORD has brought all this disaster on them.’”</p>

    <p><strong>10</strong> At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king’s house,</p>

    <p><strong>11</strong> Hiram (Chiram – Noble or Exalted) king of Tyre (Tzor – Rock) had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold, as much as he desired. King Solomon then gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee (Galil – Circle, District).</p>

    <p><strong>12</strong> But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him, they did not please him.</p>

    <p><strong>13</strong> Therefore he said, “What kind of cities are these that you have given me, my brother?” So they are called the land of Cabul (Kavul – Good for Nothing) to this day.</p>

    <p><strong>14</strong> Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents (9000 pounds) of gold.</p>

    <p><strong>15</strong> And this is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon drafted to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and the Millo (Millo – Filling or Terrace), and the wall of Jerusalem (Yerushalayim – Foundation of Peace), and Hazor (Chatzor – Enclosed Place), and Megiddo (Megiddo – Place of Troops), and Gezer (Gezer – Part or Portion)</p>

    <p><strong>16</strong> (Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burned it with fire, and had killed the Canaanites (Kena‘ani – Lowlanders) who lived in the city, and had given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife),</p>

    <p><strong>17</strong> so Solomon rebuilt Gezer, and Lower Beth-horon (Beit-Choron – House of the Hollow),</p>

    <p><strong>18</strong> and Baalath (Ba‘alat – Lady) and Tamar (Tamar – Palm Tree) in the wilderness, in the land of Judah (Yehudah – Praise),</p>

    <p><strong>19</strong> and all the store cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem (Yerushalayim – Foundation of Peace), in Lebanon (Levanon – White), and in all the land of his dominion.</p>

    <p><strong>20</strong> All the people who were left of the Amorites (Emori – Talkers), the Hittites (Chitti – Sons of Heth), the Perizzites (Perizzi – Dwellers in Open Country), the Hivites (Chivvi – Villagers), and the Jebusites (Yevusi – Treaders), who were not of the people of Israel,</p>

    <p><strong>21</strong> their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel were unable to devote to destruction—these Solomon drafted for slave labor, and so they are to this day.</p>

    <p><strong>22</strong> But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves. They were the soldiers, his officials, his commanders, his captains, his chariot commanders and his horsemen.</p>

    <p><strong>23</strong> These were the chief officers who were over Solomon’s work: 550 who had charge of the people who carried on the work.</p>

    <p><strong>24</strong> But Pharaoh’s daughter went up from the city of David to her own house that Solomon had built for her. Then he built the Millo (Millo – Filling or Terrace).</p>

    <p><strong>25</strong> Three times a year Solomon used to offer up burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar that he built to the LORD, making offerings with it before the LORD. So he finished the house.</p>

    <p><strong>26</strong> King Solomon built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber (Etzyon-Gever – Backbone of a Man), which is near Eloth (Eilot – Trees) on the shore of the Red Sea (Yam Suf – Sea of Reeds), in the land of Edom (Edom – Red).</p>

    <p><strong>27</strong> And Hiram sent with the fleet his servants, seamen who were familiar with the sea, together with the servants of Solomon.</p>

    <p><strong>28</strong> And they went to Ophir (Ofir – Abundance) and brought from there gold, 420 talents, and they brought it to King Solomon.</p>
