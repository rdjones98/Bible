    <h1>1 Kings 3</h1>

    <p><b>1.</b> Solomon (Shlomo – Peaceful) made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh (Par‘oh – Great House) king of Egypt (Mitzrayim – Double Distress). He took Pharaoh’s daughter and brought her into the city of David (David – Beloved) until he had finished building his own house, the house of the LORD (YHWH – He is), and the wall around Jerusalem (Yerushalayim – Foundation of Peace).</p>

    <p><b>2.</b> However, the people were sacrificing on the high places, because a house had not yet been built for the name of the LORD.</p>

    <p><b>3.</b> Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father, except that he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.</p>

    <p><b>4.</b> The king went to Gibeon (Giv‘on – Hill City) to sacrifice there, for that was the most prominent high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.</p>

    <p><b>5.</b> At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God (Elohim – Mighty Ones) said, “Ask what I shall give you.”</p>

    <p><b>6.</b> Solomon said, “You have shown great kindness to your servant David my father, because he walked before you in truth and righteousness and uprightness of heart with you. And you have kept for him this great kindness, and have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is today.</p>

    <p><b>7.</b> Now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king in place of David my father, though I am just a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in.</p>

    <p><b>8.</b> And your servant is among your people whom you have chosen, a great people, too many to be numbered or counted.</p>

    <p><b>9.</b> Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people, to discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of yours?”</p>

    <p><b>10.</b> It pleased the LORD that Solomon had asked this.</p>

    <p><b>11.</b> And God said to him, “Because you have asked for this, and have not asked for yourself long life, or riches, or the life of your enemies, but have asked for understanding to discern what is just—</p>

    <p><b>12.</b> behold, I now do according to your word. I give you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has been none like you before you, nor shall any like you arise after you.</p>

    <p><b>13.</b> I also give you what you did not ask for, both riches and honor, so that no king shall compare with you all your days.</p>

    <p><b>14.</b> And if you walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.”</p>

    <p><b>15.</b> Then Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.</p>

    <p><b>16.</b> Then two women who were prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.</p>

    <p><b>17.</b> The one woman said, “Oh my lord, this woman and I live in the same house. I gave birth while she was in the house.</p>

    <p><b>18.</b> On the third day after I gave birth, she also gave birth. We were together; there was no one else with us in the house—only the two of us.</p>

    <p><b>19.</b> During the night, this woman’s son died because she lay on him.</p>

    <p><b>20.</b> She arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while I slept, and laid him in her arms, and laid her dead son in my arms.</p>

    <p><b>21.</b> When I rose in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead. But when I looked at him closely in the morning, I saw that he was not the son I had borne.”</p>

    <p><b>22.</b> But the other woman said, “No, the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son.” The first said, “No, the dead one is your son, and the living one is my son.” Thus they spoke before the king.</p>

    <p><b>23.</b> Then the king said, “This one says, ‘My son is the living one, and your son is the dead one,’ and the other says, ‘No, your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.’”</p>

    <p><b>24.</b> And the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought a sword before the king.</p>

    <p><b>25.</b> And the king said, “Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other.”</p>

    <p><b>26.</b> Then the woman whose son was alive said to the king, for her heart yearned for her son, “Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means kill him.” But the other said, “He shall be neither mine nor yours; divide him.”</p>

    <p><b>27.</b> Then the king answered and said, “Give the living child to the first woman, and do not kill him; she is his mother.”</p>

    <p><b>28.</b> And all Israel heard of the judgment that the king had rendered, and they stood in awe of the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do justice.</p>
