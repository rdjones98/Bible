    <h1>1 Kings 2</h1>

    <p><b>1.</b> When the time drew near for David (David – Beloved) to die, he gave a command to Solomon (Shlomo – Peaceful) his son:</p>

    <p><b>2.</b> “I am going the way of all the earth. Be strong, and show yourself a man.</p>

    <p><b>3.</b> Keep the charge of the LORD (YHWH – He is) your God (Elohim – Mighty Ones), to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commandments, His ordinances, and His testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses (Moshe – Drawn Out), so that you may succeed in all you do and wherever you turn,</p>

    <p><b>4.</b> so that the LORD may fulfill His word that He spoke concerning me, saying, ‘If your children take heed to their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, you shall never lack a man on the throne of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives).’”</p>

    <p><b>5.</b> “Moreover, you know what Joab (Yoav – YHWH is Father) son of Zeruiah (Tzeruyah – Balm) did to me—what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner (Avner – My Father is a Lamp) son of Ner and to Amasa (Amasa – Their Burden) son of Jether (Yeter – Excellence), whom he killed, shedding the blood of war in peacetime, putting the blood of war on his belt and sandals.</p>

    <p><b>6.</b> Act according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.</p>

    <p><b>7.</b> But deal loyally with the sons of Barzillai (Barzillai – Iron-hearted) the Gileadite (Gil’adi – from Gilead – Rocky Region), and let them be among those who eat at your table, for they stood by me when I fled from Absalom (Avshalom – Father of Peace) your brother.</p>

    <p><b>8.</b> And look, there is with you Shimei (Shimei – Heard) son of Gera (Gera – Grain), the Benjaminite (Binyamini – from Benjamin – Son of the Right Hand) from Bahurim (Bahurim – Youths), who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day I went to Mahanaim (Machanayim – Two Camps). But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan (Yarden – Descender), I swore to him by the LORD, saying, ‘I will not put you to death with the sword.’</p>

    <p><b>9.</b> But now, do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man. You will know what to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood.”</p>

    <p><b>10.</b> Then David (David – Beloved) slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David.</p>

    <p><b>11.</b> The time that David reigned over Israel was forty years—seven years in Hebron (Hevron – Alliance), and thirty-three years in Jerusalem (Yerushalayim – Foundation of Peace).</p>

    <p><b>12.</b> So Solomon (Shlomo – Peaceful) sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established.</p>

    <p><b>13.</b> Then Adonijah (Adoniyahu – My Lord is YHWH), the son of Haggith (Chaggit – Festive), came to Bathsheba (Bat-Sheva – Daughter of an Oath), the mother of Solomon (Shlomo – Peaceful). She said, “Do you come in peace?” He answered, “In peace.”</p>

    <p><b>14.</b> Then he said, “I have something to say to you.” She said, “Speak.”</p>

    <p><b>15.</b> He said, “You know that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel set their faces on me to reign. But the kingdom has turned and become my brother’s, for it was his from the LORD.</p>

    <p><b>16.</b> Now I am making one request of you; do not turn me away.” She said to him, “Speak.”</p>

    <p><b>17.</b> And he said, “Please ask Solomon the king—he won’t refuse you—to give me Abishag (Avishag – My Father Wanders) the Shunammite (Shunamit – from Shunem – Resting Place) as my wife.”</p>

    <p><b>18.</b> Bathsheba said, “Very well; I will speak to the king for you.”</p>

    <p><b>19.</b> So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. The king rose to meet her and bowed to her, then sat on his throne and had a throne placed for the king’s mother, and she sat at his right hand.</p>

    <p><b>20.</b> Then she said, “I have one small request to make of you. Do not refuse me.” The king said, “Make your request, my mother, for I will not refuse you.”</p>

    <p><b>21.</b> She said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as his wife.”</p>

    <p><b>22.</b> King Solomon answered his mother, “And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for the kingdom for him as well—for he is my older brother—yes, for him and for Abiathar (Evyatar – Father of Abundance) the priest, and for Joab son of Zeruiah!”</p>

    <p><b>23.</b> Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, “God do so to me and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.</p>

    <p><b>24.</b> Now therefore, as the LORD lives, who has established me and set me on the throne of David (David – Beloved) my father, and who has made me a house as He promised—Adonijah shall be put to death today.”</p>

    <p><b>25.</b> So King Solomon sent Benaiah (Benayah – YHWH has built) son of Jehoiada (Yehoyada – YHWH Knows), and he struck him down, and he died.</p>

    <p><b>26.</b> Then the king said to Abiathar the priest, “Go to Anathoth (Anatot – Answers), to your fields, for you deserve death. But I will not kill you this day, because you carried the Ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because you shared in all my father’s hardships.”</p>

    <p><b>27.</b> So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the LORD, fulfilling the word of the LORD that He spoke concerning the house of Eli (Eli – My God) at Shiloh (Shiloh – Tranquility).</p>

    <p><b>28.</b> When the news came to Joab—for Joab had supported Adonijah, though he had not supported Absalom (Avshalom – Father of Peace)—he fled to the tent of the LORD and grasped the horns of the altar.</p>

    <p><b>29.</b> It was told King Solomon, “Joab has fled to the tent of the LORD, and he is beside the altar.” Then Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, strike him down.”</p>

    <p><b>30.</b> So Benaiah came to the tent of the LORD and said to him, “The king commands: Come out.” But he said, “No! I will die here.” So Benaiah reported to the king, “This is what Joab said, and this is how he answered me.”</p>

    <p><b>31.</b> The king said to him, “Do as he said, strike him down and bury him, and thus take away from me and from my father’s house the guilt of the blood Joab shed without cause.</p>

    <p><b>32.</b> The LORD will return his blood upon his own head, because he struck down two men more righteous and better than he—Abner son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa son of Jether (Yeter – Excellence), commander of the army of Judah (Yehudah – Praise)—and killed them with the sword without my father David knowing.</p>

    <p><b>33.</b> So their blood shall return upon the head of Joab and his descendants forever, but for David, his descendants, his house, and his throne, there shall be peace from the LORD forever.”</p>

    <p><b>34.</b> Then Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck Joab down and killed him, and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</p>

    <p><b>35.</b> The king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab’s place, and the king appointed Zadok (Tzadok – Righteous) the priest in Abiathar’s place.</p>

    <p><b>36.</b> Then the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem (Yerushalayim – Foundation of Peace) and live there, and do not go out from there to any place whatever.</p>

    <p><b>37.</b> For on the day you go out and cross the Brook Kidron (Kidron – Dark), know for certain that you shall surely die. Your blood shall be on your own head.”</p>

    <p><b>38.</b> Shimei said to the king, “What you say is good. As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.</p>

    <p><b>39.</b> But at the end of three years, two of Shimei’s servants ran away to Achish (Akhish – I Will Enchant), son of Maacah (Ma‘akhah – Oppression), king of Gath (Gat – Winepress). And they told Shimei, “Your servants are in Gath.”</p>

    <p><b>40.</b> So Shimei arose, saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.</p>

    <p><b>41.</b> It was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and returned.</p>

    <p><b>42.</b> So the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the LORD and solemnly warn you, saying, ‘Know for certain that on the day you go out and go to any place, you shall surely die’? And you said to me, ‘The word is good; I will obey.’</p>

    <p><b>43.</b> Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD and the commandment I gave you?”</p>

    <p><b>44.</b> The king also said to Shimei, “You know in your heart all the evil that you did to David my father. So the LORD will return your evil on your own head.</p>

    <p><b>45.</b> But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever.”</p>

    <p><b>46.</b> Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down, and he died. So the kingdom was firmly established in the hand of Solomon.</p>
