    <h1>1 Kings 6</h1>

    <p><b>1.</b> In the four hundred and eightieth year after the people of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives) came out of the land of Egypt (Mitzrayim – Double Distress), in the fourth year of Solomon’s (Shlomo – Peaceful) reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv (Ziv – Brightness), which is the second month, he began to build the house of the LORD (YHWH – He is).</p>

    <p><b>2.</b> The house that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.</p>

    <p><b>3.</b> The porch in front of the temple hall of the house was twenty cubits in length, corresponding to the width of the house, and ten cubits deep in front of the house.</p>

    <p><b>4.</b> He made for the house windows with recessed frames.</p>

    <p><b>5.</b> Against the wall of the house he built side rooms all around, against both the sanctuary and the inner sanctuary; he made side rooms all around.</p>

    <p><b>6.</b> The lowest side chamber was five cubits wide, the middle was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for he made offsets in the wall of the house all around so that the beams would not be inserted into the walls of the house.</p>

    <p><b>7.</b> The house was built with stone prepared at the quarry, so that no hammer or axe or any iron tool was heard in the house while it was being built.</p>

    <p><b>8.</b> The entrance for the lowest side chamber was on the right side of the house, and stairs led up to the middle chamber, and from the middle to the third.</p>

    <p><b>9.</b> So he built the house and finished it, and covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.</p>

    <p><b>10.</b> He built the side chambers against all the house, each five cubits high, and they were attached to the house with cedar beams.</p>

    <p><b>11.</b> The word of the LORD (YHWH – He is) came to Solomon:</p>

    <p><b>12.</b> “Concerning this house that you are building, if you walk in my statutes and obey my rules and keep all my commandments and walk in them, then I will establish my word with you, which I spoke to David (David – Beloved) your father.</p>

    <p><b>13.</b> And I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake my people Israel.”</p>

    <p><b>14.</b> So Solomon built the house and finished it.</p>

    <p><b>15.</b> He lined the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar. From the floor of the house to the rafters of the ceiling, he covered them with wood on the inside, and he overlaid the floor of the house with boards of cypress.</p>

    <p><b>16.</b> He built twenty cubits of the rear part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling, and he built it as an inner sanctuary, as the Most Holy Place.</p>

    <p><b>17.</b> The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long.</p>

    <p><b>18.</b> The cedar inside the house was carved in the form of gourds and open flowers. All was cedar; no stone was seen.</p>

    <p><b>19.</b> He prepared the inner sanctuary in the innermost part of the house to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD (YHWH – He is).</p>

    <p><b>20.</b> The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. He overlaid it with pure gold, and he overlaid the altar with cedar.</p>

    <p><b>21.</b> Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold. And he drew chains of gold across in front of the inner sanctuary and overlaid it with gold.</p>

    <p><b>22.</b> He overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. Also the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.</p>

    <p><b>23.</b> In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.</p>

    <p><b>24.</b> Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub; from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other was ten cubits.</p>

    <p><b>25.</b> The other cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same size and shape.</p>

    <p><b>26.</b> The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was the other cherub.</p>

    <p><b>27.</b> He put the cherubim in the inner house, and the wings of the cherubim were stretched out, so that the wing of one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall. Their wings touched each other in the middle of the house.</p>

    <p><b>28.</b> He overlaid the cherubim with gold.</p>

    <p><b>29.</b> Around all the walls of the house he carved carved figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, in both the inner and outer rooms.</p>

    <p><b>30.</b> He overlaid the floor of the house with gold, in the inner and outer rooms.</p>

    <p><b>31.</b> For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood. The lintel and doorposts formed a pentagon.</p>

    <p><b>32.</b> He carved on the doors of olive wood figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim and palm trees.</p>

    <p><b>33.</b> So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olive wood, in the form of a square,</p>

    <p><b>34.</b> and two doors of cypress wood. The two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</p>

    <p><b>35.</b> He carved on them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work.</p>

    <p><b>36.</b> He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone and one course of cedar beams.</p>

    <p><b>37.</b> In the fourth year, in the month of Ziv, the foundation of the house of the LORD (YHWH – He is) was laid.</p>

    <p><b>38.</b> In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul (Bul – Rain), which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its parts and according to all its plans. So he was seven years in building it.</p>
