  <h1>Meaning of "Sons of God" in Genesis 6:2</h1>

  <p>In Genesis 6:2, the term <strong>"sons of God"</strong> is translated from the Hebrew phrase <em>בְּנֵי הָאֱלֹהִים</em> (<strong>B'nei HaElohim</strong>).</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>בְּנֵי</strong> (<em>B'nei</em>) means "sons" or "children."</li>
    <li><strong>הָאֱלֹהִים</strong> (<em>HaElohim</em>) means "the gods" or "God," often referring to the singular God when used in specific contexts, but in this case, it’s interpreted as "God" (Elohim).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This phrase is commonly understood to refer to divine or heavenly beings. There are different interpretations of the term <strong>"sons of God"</strong> in this verse, but the most prevalent interpretations are:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Divine beings or angels:</strong> Some believe that this refers to angelic beings who took human wives and produced offspring (giants or Nephilim).</li>
    <li><strong>Line of Seth (righteous descendants):</strong> Another interpretation is that it refers to the descendants of Seth, the son of Adam, who were seen as godly or righteous, contrasting with the "daughters of men" from the line of Cain.</li>
  </ol>
