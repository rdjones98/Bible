<h1>Goliath (Golyat – possibly “Exile” or “Splendor”)</h1>

<p>Goliath was a Philistine (Pelishti – Immigrant) warrior from <strong>Gath (Gat – Winepress)</strong>, described in <strong>1 Samuel 17</strong> as a fearsome giant and champion. His name’s exact meaning is uncertain but may relate to “exile” or “splendor.”</p>

<h2>Physical Description</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Height: <strong>Six cubits and a span</strong> (approximately 9 feet 9 inches / 3 meters), though some ancient texts say 4 cubits and a span (6’9”).</li>
  <li>Wore bronze armor weighing about 125–150 pounds (57–68 kg).</li>
  <li>Spear shaft was like a weaver’s beam; iron point weighed about 15–18 pounds (7–8 kg).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Role in the Battle</h2>
<p>Goliath challenged Israel to single combat and mocked the God (Elohim – Mighty Ones) of Israel. He was defeated by <strong>David (David – Beloved)</strong>, a young shepherd who struck him in the forehead with a stone from a sling and then cut off his head with Goliath’s own sword.</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Symbol of seemingly invincible enemies.</li>
  <li>"David vs. Goliath" has become a universal metaphor for underdog victory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goliath’s Brothers and Kin</h2>
<p>According to <strong>2 Samuel 21:15–22</strong> and <strong>1 Chronicles 20:4–8</strong>, Goliath had brothers or close relatives who were also giants:</p>

      <td>Descendant of Rapha</td>
      <td>Had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot (24 digits)</td>
      <td>Jonathan son of Shimea (David’s brother)</td>
    </tr>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Goliath was not alone—he was part of a warrior class of giants rooted in the Philistine city of Gath and descended from the <strong>Rephaim</strong>. His defeat by David began a series of victories by David and his men over these giants, demonstrating divine support for Israel’s king and people.</p>
