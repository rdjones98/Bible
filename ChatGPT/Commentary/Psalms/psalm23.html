  <p><strong>"The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want."</strong></p>

  <h2>1. "The LORD is my shepherd"</h2>
  <p><strong>Jesus as the Good Shepherd:</strong> In <em>John 10:11</em>, Jesus says, <blockquote>"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep."</blockquote> He leads, protects, and provides, just as a shepherd does. The care described in Psalm 23 reflects Christ’s personal relationship with His followers.</p>

  <h2>2. "He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters."</h2>
  <p><strong>Provision and Peace:</strong> Jesus offers spiritual rest and nourishment (see <em>Matthew 11:28–29</em>). The "green pastures" and "still waters" represent the peace and life Jesus gives through His Word and Spirit.</p>

  <h2>3. "He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for His name's sake."</h2>
  <p><strong>Restoration and Righteousness:</strong> Jesus restores the broken and guides His people in holiness. In <em>John 14:6</em>, He says, <blockquote>"I am the way, and the truth, and the life."</blockquote> He leads in the path of righteousness not just by teaching it, but by being it.</p>

  <h2>4. "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me."</h2>
  <p><strong>Jesus' Presence in Suffering:</strong> He walks with us through suffering and death. He Himself went through death and conquered it (<em>Hebrews 2:14–15</em>), so we no longer need to fear it.</p>

  <h2>5. "Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me."</h2>
  <p><strong>Protection and Guidance:</strong> The rod (defense) and staff (guidance) reflect the authority and care Jesus exercises over His people. Jesus corrects, protects, and directs His followers.</p>

  <h2>6. "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows."</h2>
  <p><strong>Abundant Blessing Amidst Opposition:</strong> This can point to the victory and provision Christ gives even in hostile circumstances. The "table" and "cup" are often connected to communion — the New Covenant meal given by Jesus, symbolizing His sacrificial love.</p>

  <h2>7. "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD forever."</h2>
  <p><strong>Eternal Life with Jesus:</strong> Jesus promises eternal life to those who believe in Him (<em>John 14:2–3</em>; <em>John 10:28</em>). The "house of the LORD" becomes, in Christian theology, both the presence of God now and the eternal home to come.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Psalm 23 paints a portrait of deep trust in God's care and presence. Christians see Jesus as the fulfillment of this psalm — the Good Shepherd who knows His sheep, gives His life for them, walks with them through suffering, and leads them to eternal life. In this way, Psalm 23 is not just poetic comfort, but a prophetic glimpse of Christ’s role as Shepherd-King.</p>
