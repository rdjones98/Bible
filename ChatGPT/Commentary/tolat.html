  <h1>Psalm 22:6 – The Meaning of "Worm" (Tola'at)</h1>

  <h2>1. Literal Meaning</h2>
  <p>
    The Hebrew word used in Psalm 22:6 for "worm" is <strong>תּוֹלַעַת (tola'at)</strong>. Literally, this word refers to a lowly worm or maggot—
    a small, crawling creature associated with decay and insignificance. In the context of the verse, it expresses the psalmist's extreme sense
    of humiliation and degradation:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"But I am a worm, and not a man, a reproach of men and despised by the people." (Psalm 22:6, NASB)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The psalmist does not merely feel small—he feels subhuman, scorned, and entirely devalued by others. The term "worm" is thus an intense
    image of vulnerability, contempt, and shame.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Symbolic and Theological Significance</h2>
  <p>
    Beyond its literal sense, <strong>tola'at</strong> carries symbolic weight, especially in theological interpretation. The word refers not just
    to any worm, but specifically to the <em>crimson worm</em> (<em>Coccus ilicis</em>), which was historically used to produce a red dye. This
    crimson dye was used in the tabernacle and priestly garments (see Exodus 26:1; 28:5), giving the word cultic significance in relation to
    sacrifice and holiness.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Christian theology, the use of <strong>tola'at</strong> in Psalm 22 is often seen as a prophetic foreshadowing of Jesus Christ’s suffering and
    crucifixion. Psalm 22 is widely regarded as a Messianic psalm, and Jesus quotes from it on the cross (Matthew 27:46; Mark 15:34). In this
    interpretation, the "worm" symbolizes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Jesus’ voluntary humility and degradation (Philippians 2:6–8)</li>
    <li>The scorn and mockery He endured during the Passion (Matthew 27:29–31)</li>
    <li>The shedding of His blood, represented by the red dye of the crimson worm</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Biblical Cross-References</h2>
  <p>
    Other passages that echo or shed light on this concept include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Isaiah 41:14</strong> – "Do not fear, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel; I will help you," declares the Lord (YHWH – He is).</li>
    <li><strong>Job 25:6</strong> – "How much less man, that maggot, and the son of man, that worm!"</li>
    <li><strong>Exodus 26:1</strong> and <strong>28:5</strong> – References to the scarlet/crimson material (Hebrew: tola'at shani) used in priestly
    and tabernacle garments.</li>
    <li><strong>Philippians 2:6–8</strong> – Speaks of Christ’s humility and death on a cross.</li>
    <li><strong>Matthew 27:46</strong> and <strong>Mark 15:34</strong> – Jesus cries out, quoting Psalm 22:1.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Thus, Psalm 22:6 uses the word "worm" not only as a vivid expression of human shame and suffering but also as a deeply meaningful
    image in redemptive history—ultimately pointing to the suffering and sacrificial role of the Messiah.
