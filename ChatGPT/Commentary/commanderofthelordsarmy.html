<h1>The Man with the Sword in Joshua 5</h1>

<p>Great question — the identity of the <strong>man with the sword</strong> in <strong>Joshua 5:13–15</strong> has been discussed and debated for centuries, and it’s a deeply rich moment in the text. Here’s a breakdown of what we can say from the text itself and how it's been interpreted:</p>

<h2>📜 What the Text Says</h2>
<p>In <strong>Joshua 5:13–15</strong>, Joshua meets a man with a drawn sword, who identifies himself as:</p>

<blockquote>
  “<strong>Commander of the army of the Lord</strong> (YHWH – He is).”
</blockquote>

<p>Joshua falls to the ground in reverence, and the man tells him:</p>

<blockquote>
  “Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy.”
</blockquote>

<p>That echoes what was said to <strong>Moses at the burning bush</strong> (<strong>Exodus 3:5</strong>), where Moses encountered <strong>God Himself</strong>.</p>

<h2>🔍 Interpretation #1: A Theophany (Appearance of YHWH Himself)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>language and setting</strong> (holy ground, worship not rebuked, direct command) strongly resemble <strong>divine encounters</strong> elsewhere in the Bible.</li>
  <li>Some scholars and traditions say this is <strong>YHWH Himself</strong>, appearing in <strong>human-like form</strong>, also called a <strong>theophany</strong>.</li>
  <li>Joshua bows down — and unlike other angelic encounters (like in Revelation), the figure <strong>does not tell him to stop</strong>. That suggests divinity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🔍 Interpretation #2: The Angel (Messenger) of YHWH</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Another very strong interpretation is that this is the <strong>Angel of the Lord</strong> — a special figure who <strong>speaks with God’s authority</strong> and at times seems indistinguishable from God (e.g., Genesis 16, Exodus 3, Judges 6).</li>
  <li>In some traditions, the <strong>Angel of YHWH</strong> is considered a <strong>pre-incarnate appearance</strong> of the <strong>Messiah</strong> (a “Christophany”), especially in Christian theology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>⚔️ Summary:</h2>
<p><strong>Who is the man with the sword?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Most likely, he is either:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>YHWH Himself</strong> appearing in human form (a theophany), or</li>
    <li><strong>The Angel of YHWH</strong>, who speaks as and for YHWH, often considered a visible, personal manifestation of God.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>Either way, it’s <strong>no ordinary angel</strong> — this figure represents <strong>God’s personal leadership in the coming battle</strong>.</p>
