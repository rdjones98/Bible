    <h1>Psalm 3</h1>
	
	<a href="../Commentary/Psalms/psalm3.html">Jesus as the fullfillment of this psalm.</a>
	
    <p><em>A Psalm of David (David – Beloved), when he fled from Absalom (Avshalom – Father of Peace) his son.</em></p>

    <p><strong>1</strong> LORD (YHWH – He is), how many are my foes! Many are rising up against me.</p>

    <p><strong>2</strong> Many are saying of my soul, “There is no salvation for him in God (Elohim – Mighty Ones).” Selah.</p>

    <p><strong>3</strong> But You, LORD, are a shield around me, my glory, and the One who lifts up my head.</p>

    <p><strong>4</strong> I cried aloud to the LORD, and He answered me from His holy mountain. Selah.</p>

    <p><strong>5</strong> I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the LORD sustained me.</p>

    <p><strong>6</strong> I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.</p>

    <p><strong>7</strong> Arise, LORD! Save me, my God! For You strike all my enemies on the cheek; You break the teeth of the wicked.</p>

    <p><strong>8</strong> Salvation belongs to the LORD; Your blessing be on Your people. Selah.</p>
