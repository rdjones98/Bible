    <h1>Psalm 150</h1>

    <p><b>1.</b> Praise the LORD (YHWH – He is)! Praise God (El – Mighty One) in His sanctuary; praise Him in the firmament of His power!</p>

    <p><b>2.</b> Praise Him for His mighty deeds; praise Him according to His abundant greatness!</p>

    <p><b>3.</b> Praise Him with the blast of the ram’s horn; praise Him with harp and lyre!</p>

    <p><b>4.</b> Praise Him with tambourine and dance; praise Him with strings and pipe!</p>

    <p><b>5.</b> Praise Him with sounding cymbals; praise Him with resounding cymbals!</p>

    <p><b>6.</b> Let everything that has breath praise the LORD (YHWH – He is)! Praise the LORD (YHWH – He is)!</p>
