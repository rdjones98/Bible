    <h1>Psalm 19</h1>
<a href="../Commentary/Psalms/psalm19.html">Jesus as the fullfillment of this psalm.</a>

    <p><strong>1</strong> The heavens declare the glory of God (El – Mighty One), and the sky above proclaims the work of His hands.</p>

    <p><strong>2</strong> Day to day pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.</p>

    <p><strong>3</strong> There is no speech, and there are no words; their voice is not heard.</p>

    <p><strong>4</strong> Yet their line has gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them He has set a tent for the sun,</p>

    <p><strong>5</strong> which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and rejoices like a strong man to run his course.</p>

    <p><strong>6</strong> Its rising is from one end of the heavens, and its circuit to the other end, and nothing is hidden from its heat.</p>

    <p><strong>7</strong> The Torah of the LORD (YHWH – He is) is perfect, reviving the soul. The testimony of the LORD (YHWH – He is) is trustworthy, making the simple wise.</p>

    <p><strong>8</strong> The precepts of the LORD (YHWH – He is) are right, rejoicing the heart. The commandment of the LORD (YHWH – He is) is pure, enlightening the eyes.</p>

    <p><strong>9</strong> The fear of the LORD (YHWH – He is) is clean, enduring forever. The judgments of the LORD (YHWH – He is) are true; they are righteous altogether.</p>

    <p><strong>10</strong> They are more desirable than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings from the honeycomb.</p>

    <p><strong>11</strong> Moreover, by them Your servant is warned; in keeping them there is great reward.</p>

    <p><strong>12</strong> Who can discern his errors? Cleanse me from hidden faults.</p>

    <p><strong>13</strong> Keep Your servant also from arrogant sins; let them not rule over me. Then I shall be blameless and innocent of great transgression.</p>

    <p><strong>14</strong> Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in Your sight, O LORD (YHWH – He is), my rock and my redeemer.</p>
