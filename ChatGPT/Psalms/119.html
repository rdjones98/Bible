    <h1>Psalm 119</h1>
<h2>Aleph (א)</h2>
<p><strong>1</strong> Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of the LORD (YHWH – He is).</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> Blessed are those who keep His testimonies, who seek Him with their whole heart.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> They also do no unrighteousness; they walk in His ways.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> You have commanded Your precepts to be kept diligently.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> Oh that my ways were steadfast to keep Your statutes!</p>
<p><strong>6</strong> Then I would not be ashamed when I look upon all Your commandments.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong> I will praise You with an upright heart when I learn Your righteous judgments.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong> I will keep Your statutes; do not utterly forsake me.</p>
<h2>Bet (ב)</h2>
<p><strong>9</strong> How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to Your word.</p>
<p><strong>10</strong> With my whole heart I seek You; do not let me wander from Your commandments.</p>
<p><strong>11</strong> I have hidden Your word in my heart, that I might not sin against You.</p>
<p><strong>12</strong> Blessed are You, O LORD (YHWH – He is); teach me Your statutes.</p>
<p><strong>13</strong> With my lips I declare all the judgments of Your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>14</strong> I rejoice in the way of Your testimonies as much as in all riches.</p>
<p><strong>15</strong> I will meditate on Your precepts and consider Your paths.</p>
<p><strong>16</strong> I will delight myself in Your statutes; I will not forget Your word.</p>
<h2>Gimel (ג)</h2>
<p><strong>17</strong> Deal bountifully with Your servant, that I may live and keep Your word.</p>
<p><strong>18</strong> Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Your law.</p>
<p><strong>19</strong> I am a sojourner on the earth; do not hide Your commandments from me.</p>
<p><strong>20</strong> My soul is consumed with longing for Your judgments at all times.</p>
<p><strong>21</strong> You rebuke the arrogant, the cursed, who stray from Your commandments.</p>
<p><strong>22</strong> Take away from me scorn and contempt, for I have kept Your testimonies.</p>
<p><strong>23</strong> Though princes sit and speak against me, Your servant meditates on Your statutes.</p>
<p><strong>24</strong> Your testimonies also are my delight and my counselors.</p>
<h2>Dalet (ד)</h2>
<p><strong>25</strong> My soul clings to the dust; revive me according to Your word.</p>
<p><strong>26</strong> I declared my ways and You answered me; teach me Your statutes.</p>
<p><strong>27</strong> Make me understand the way of Your precepts, so I will meditate on Your wondrous works.</p>
<p><strong>28</strong> My soul melts away for sorrow; strengthen me according to Your word.</p>
<p><strong>29</strong> Remove from me the way of falsehood, and graciously grant me Your law.</p>
<p><strong>30</strong> I have chosen the way of faithfulness; I have set Your judgments before me.</p>
<p><strong>31</strong> I cling to Your testimonies, O LORD (YHWH – He is); do not let me be put to shame.</p>
<p><strong>32</strong> I will run in the path of Your commandments, for You have set my heart free.</p>
<h2>He (ה)</h2>
<p><strong>33</strong> Teach me, O LORD (YHWH – He is), the way of Your statutes, and I shall keep it to the end.</p>
<p><strong>34</strong> Give me understanding, and I shall keep Your law; yes, I shall observe it with my whole heart.</p>
<p><strong>35</strong> Make me walk in the path of Your commandments, for I delight in it.</p>
<p><strong>36</strong> Incline my heart to Your testimonies, and not to dishonest gain.</p>
<p><strong>37</strong> Turn my eyes away from looking at vanity, and revive me in Your ways.</p>
<p><strong>38</strong> Establish Your word to Your servant, who is devoted to fearing You.</p>
<p><strong>39</strong> Turn away the disgrace that I dread, for Your judgments are good.</p>
<p><strong>40</strong> Behold, I long for Your precepts; revive me in Your righteousness.</p>
<h2>Vav (ו)</h2>
<p><strong>41</strong> Let Your steadfast love come to me, O LORD (YHWH – He is), Your salvation according to Your word.</p>
<p><strong>42</strong> Then I shall have an answer for him who reproaches me, for I trust in Your word.</p>
<p><strong>43</strong> And do not take the word of truth utterly out of my mouth, for I have hoped in Your judgments.</p>
<p><strong>44</strong> So I will keep Your law continually, forever and ever.</p>
<p><strong>45</strong> And I will walk at liberty, for I have sought Your precepts.</p>
<p><strong>46</strong> I will also speak of Your testimonies before kings and will not be put to shame,</p>
<p><strong>47</strong> because I find my delight in Your commandments, which I love.</p>
<p><strong>48</strong> I will lift up my hands toward Your commandments, which I love, and I will meditate on Your statutes.</p>
<h2>Zayin (ז)</h2>
<p><strong>49</strong> Remember Your word to Your servant, in which You have made me hope.</p>
<p><strong>50</strong> This is my comfort in my affliction, that Your promise gives me life.</p>
<p><strong>51</strong> The insolent utterly deride me, but I do not turn away from Your law.</p>
<p><strong>52</strong> When I think of Your rules from of old, I take comfort, O LORD (YHWH – He is).</p>
<p><strong>53</strong> Hot indignation seizes me because of the wicked, who forsake Your law.</p>
<p><strong>54</strong> Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my sojourning.</p>
<p><strong>55</strong> I remember Your name in the night, O LORD (YHWH – He is), and keep Your law.</p>
<p><strong>56</strong> This blessing has fallen to me, that I have kept Your precepts.</p>
<h2>Chet (ח)</h2>
<p><strong>57</strong> The LORD (YHWH – He is) is my portion; I have promised to keep Your words.</p>
<p><strong>58</strong> I have sought Your face with all my heart; be gracious to me according to Your word.</p>
<p><strong>59</strong> I considered my ways and turned my feet to Your testimonies.</p>
<p><strong>60</strong> I hurried and did not delay to keep Your commandments.</p>
<p><strong>61</strong> Though the cords of the wicked have bound me, I have not forgotten Your law.</p>
<p><strong>62</strong> At midnight I rise to give thanks to You because of Your righteous judgments.</p>
<p><strong>63</strong> I am a companion of all those who fear You and of those who keep Your precepts.</p>
<p><strong>64</strong> The earth, O LORD (YHWH – He is), is full of Your steadfast love; teach me Your statutes.</p>
<h2>Tet (ט)</h2>

<p><b>72</b> The law of Your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces.</p>

<h2>Yod (י)</h2>
<p><b>73</b> Your hands have made me and established me; give me understanding so that I may learn Your commandments.</p>

<p><b>74</b> Those who fear You will see me and rejoice, because I have hoped in Your word.</p>

<p><b>75</b> I know, O LORD (YHWH – He is), that Your judgments are righteous, and that in faithfulness You have afflicted me.</p>

<p><b>76</b> Let Your lovingkindness comfort me, according to Your promise to Your servant.</p>

<p><b>80</b> Let my heart be blameless in Your statutes, so that I may not be put to shame.</p>
<h2>Kaf (כ)</h2>
<p><b>81</b> My soul longs for Your salvation; I hope in Your word.</p>

<p><b>82</b> My eyes fail, longing for Your promise, saying, “When will You comfort me?”</p>

<p><b>83</b> For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, yet I have not forgotten Your statutes.</p>

<p><b>84</b> How many are the days of Your servant? When will You execute judgment on those who persecute me?</p>

<p><b>85</b> The arrogant have dug pits for me—those who do not follow Your law.</p>

<p><b>86</b> All Your commandments are faithful; they persecute me with lies—help me!</p>

<p><b>87</b> They almost wiped me from the earth, but I did not forsake Your precepts.</p>

<p><b>88</b> Give me life according to Your lovingkindness, so that I may keep the testimony of Your mouth.</p>
<h2>Lamed (ל)</h2>
<p><b>89</b> Forever, O LORD (YHWH – He is), Your word stands firm in the heavens.</p>

<p><b>90</b> Your faithfulness endures to all generations; You established the earth, and it stands.</p>

<p><b>91</b> By Your ordinances they stand to this day, for all things are Your servants.</p>

<p><b>92</b> If Your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction.</p>

<p><b>93</b> I will never forget Your precepts, for by them You have given me life.</p>

<p><b>94</b> I am Yours—save me! For I have sought Your precepts.</p>

<p><b>95</b> The wicked wait for me to destroy me, but I will consider Your testimonies.</p>

<p><b>96</b> I have seen a limit to all perfection, but Your commandment is exceedingly broad.</p>
