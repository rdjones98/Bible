    <h1>Psalm 2</h1>
<a href="../Commentary/psalm2.html">Jesus as the fullfillment of this psalm.</a>

    <p><strong>1</strong> Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot in vain?</p>

    <p><strong>2</strong> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD (YHWH – He is) and against His Anointed, saying,</p>

    <p><strong>3</strong> “Let us break their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us!”</p>

    <p><strong>4</strong> He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord (Adonai – Master) holds them in derision.</p>

    <p><strong>5</strong> Then He will speak to them in His wrath, and terrify them in His fierce anger, saying,</p>

    <p><strong>6</strong> “But I have set My king on Tziyon (Zion – Fortress), My holy mountain.”</p>

    <p><strong>7</strong> I will proclaim the decree: The LORD (YHWH – He is) said to me, “You are My Son; today I have begotten You.</p>

    <p><strong>8</strong> Ask of Me, and I will make the nations Your inheritance, and the ends of the earth Your possession.</p>

    <p><strong>9</strong> You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall shatter them like a potter’s vessel.”</p>

    <p><strong>10</strong> Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth.</p>

    <p><strong>11</strong> Serve the LORD (YHWH – He is) with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p>

    <p><strong>12</strong> Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and you perish in the way, for His wrath may soon be kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in Him.</p>
