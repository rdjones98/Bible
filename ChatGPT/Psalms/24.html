    <h1>Psalm 24</h1>
<a href="../Commentary/Psalms/psalm24.html">Jesus as the fullfillment of this psalm.</a>
    <p><strong>1</strong> The earth is the LORD’s (YHWH – He is), and everything in it, the world and those who dwell in it.</p>

    <p><strong>2</strong> For He has founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the rivers.</p>

    <p><strong>3</strong> Who may ascend the mountain of the LORD (YHWH – He is)? Who may stand in His holy place?</p>

    <p><strong>4</strong> The one who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to falsehood, and does not swear deceitfully.</p>

    <p><strong>5</strong> He will receive blessing from the LORD (YHWH – He is), and righteousness from the God (Elohim – Mighty Ones) of his salvation.</p>

    <p><strong>6</strong> Such is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek Your face—Jacob (Ya‘aqov – Heel Grabber), Selah.</p>

    <p><strong>7</strong> Lift up your heads, O gates! Be lifted up, you everlasting doors, that the King of glory may come in!</p>

    <p><strong>8</strong> Who is this King of glory? The LORD (YHWH – He is), strong and mighty, the LORD (YHWH – He is), mighty in battle.</p>

    <p><strong>9</strong> Lift up your heads, O gates! Lift them up, you everlasting doors, that the King of glory may come in!</p>

    <p><strong>10</strong> Who is He, this King of glory? The LORD (YHWH – He is) of hosts (YHWH Tzeva’ot – He is, Commander of Armies), He is the King of glory. Selah.</p>
