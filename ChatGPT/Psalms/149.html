    <h1>Psalm 149</h1>

    <p><b>1.</b> Praise the LORD (YHWH – He is)! Sing to the LORD (YHWH – He is) a new song, His praise in the assembly of the faithful!</p>

    <p><b>2.</b> Let Israel (Yisra’el – God strives) rejoice in his Maker; let the children of Zion (Tziyon – Parched Place) be joyful in their King!</p>

    <p><b>3.</b> Let them praise His name with dancing; let them make music to Him with tambourine and lyre!</p>

    <p><b>4.</b> For the LORD (YHWH – He is) takes pleasure in His people; He adorns the humble with salvation.</p>

    <p><b>5.</b> Let the faithful exult in glory; let them shout for joy on their beds.</p>

    <p><b>6.</b> The high praises of God (Elohim – Mighty Ones) in their throats and a two-edged sword in their hands,</p>

    <p><b>7.</b> to execute vengeance on the nations and punishments on the peoples,</p>

    <p><b>8.</b> to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with iron shackles,</p>

    <p><b>9.</b> to carry out the written judgment against them. This is the honor of all His faithful ones. Praise the LORD (YHWH – He is)!</p>
