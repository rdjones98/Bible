    <h1>Psalm 148</h1>

    <p><b>1.</b> Praise the LORD (YHWH – He is)! Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise Him in the heights!</p>

    <p><b>2.</b> Praise Him, all His messengers! Praise Him, all His hosts!</p>

    <p><b>3.</b> Praise Him, sun and moon! Praise Him, all you shining stars!</p>

    <p><b>4.</b> Praise Him, highest heavens, and you waters above the heavens!</p>

    <p><b>5.</b> Let them praise the name of the LORD, for He commanded, and they were created.</p>

    <p><b>6.</b> He established them forever and ever; He gave a decree, and it shall not pass away.</p>

    <p><b>7.</b> Praise the LORD from the earth, <a href="../Commentary/Tannin.html">sea monsters (Tanninim - serpent, dragon, sea monster)</a> and all the depths,</p>

    <p><b>8.</b> Fire and hail, snow and mist, stormy wind fulfilling His word!</p>

    <p><b>9.</b> Mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars!</p>

    <p><b>10.</b> Wild animals and all cattle, creeping things and flying birds!</p>

    <p><b>11.</b> Kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all judges of the earth!</p>

    <p><b>12.</b> Young men and also young women, old men with children!</p>

    <p><b>13.</b> Let them praise the name of the LORD, for His name alone is exalted; His majesty is above earth and heaven.</p>

    <p><b>14.</b> And He has raised up a horn for His people, praise for all His faithful ones, for the children of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives), the people near to Him. Praise the LORD!</p>
