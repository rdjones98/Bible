    <h1>Psalm 51</h1>
<a href="../Commentary/Psalms/psalm51.html">Jesus as the fullfillment of this psalm.</a>

    <p><strong>1</strong> Have mercy on me, O God (Elohim – Mighty Ones), according to Your steadfast love; according to the greatness of Your compassion, blot out my transgressions.</p>

    <p><strong>2</strong> Wash me thoroughly from my guilt, and cleanse me from my sin.</p>

    <p><strong>3</strong> For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.</p>

    <p><strong>4</strong> Against You—You alone—I have sinned, and done what is evil in Your sight, so that You are right when You speak and pure when You judge.</p>

    <p><strong>5</strong> Behold, I was brought forth in guilt, and in sin my mother conceived me.</p>

    <p><strong>6</strong> Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being, and in the hidden part You make me know wisdom.</p>

    <p><strong>7</strong> Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>

    <p><strong>8</strong> Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones You have crushed rejoice.</p>

    <p><strong>9</strong> Hide Your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.</p>

    <p><strong>10</strong> Create in me a pure heart, O God (Elohim – Mighty Ones), and renew a steadfast spirit within me.</p>

    <p><strong>11</strong> Do not cast me away from Your presence, and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.</p>

    <p><strong>12</strong> Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.</p>

    <p><strong>13</strong> Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, and sinners will return to You.</p>

    <p><strong>14</strong> Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God (Elohim – Mighty Ones), God (Elohim – Mighty Ones) of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of Your righteousness.</p>

    <p><strong>15</strong> O Lord (Adonai – My Lord), open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise.</p>

    <p><strong>16</strong> For You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; You are not pleased with burnt offering.</p>

    <p><strong>17</strong> The sacrifices of God (Elohim – Mighty Ones) are a broken spirit; a broken and crushed heart, O God (Elohim – Mighty Ones), You will not despise.</p>

    <p><strong>18</strong> Do good in Your favor to Zion (Tziyon – Parched Place); build the walls of Jerusalem (Yerushalayim – Foundation of Peace).</p>

    <p><strong>19</strong> Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices, burnt offerings and whole offerings; then bulls will be offered on Your altar.</p>
