<h1>Psalm 22</h1>
<a href="../Commentary/psalm22.html">Comparison to the Gospels</a>
<p><b>1</b> My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? Why are You so far from saving me, from the words of my groaning?</p>

<p><b>2</b> O my God, I cry by day, but You do not answer, and by night, but I find no rest.</p>

<p><b>3</b> Yet You are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives).</p>

<p><b>4</b> In You our fathers trusted; they trusted, and You delivered them.</p>

<p><b>5</b> To You they cried and were rescued; in You they trusted and were not put to shame.</p>

<p><b>6</b> But I am a <a href="../Commentary/tolat.html">worm (tola'at)</a> and not a man, scorned by mankind and despised by the people.</p>

<p><b>7</b> All who see me mock me; they make mouths at me; they wag their heads:</p>

<p><b>8</b> “He trusts in the LORD (YHWH – He is); let Him deliver him; let Him rescue him, for He delights in him!”</p>

<p><b>9</b> Yet You are He who took me from the womb; You made me trust You at my mother's breasts.</p>

<p><b>10</b> On You was I cast from my birth, and from my mother's womb You have been my God.</p>

<p><b>11</b> Be not far from me, for trouble is near, and there is none to help.</p>

<p><b>12</b> Many bulls encompass me; strong bulls of Bashan surround me;</p>

<p><b>13</b> they open wide their mouths at me, like a ravening and roaring lion.</p>

<p><b>14</b> I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax; it is melted within my breast;</p>

<p><b>15</b> my strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to my jaws; You lay me in the dust of death.</p>

<p><b>16</b> For dogs encompass me; a company of evildoers encircles me; like a lion, they are at my hands and feet.</p>

<p><b>17</b> I can count all my bones—they stare and gloat over me;</p>

<p><b>18</b> they divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots.</p>

<p><b>19</b> But You, O LORD, do not be far off! O You my help, come quickly to my aid!</p>

<p><b>20</b> Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dog!</p>

<p><b>21</b> Save me from the mouth of the lion! You have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen!</p>

<p><b>22</b> I will tell of Your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will praise You:</p>

<p><b>23</b> You who fear the LORD, praise Him! All you offspring of Jacob (Ya‘aqov – Supplanter), glorify Him, and stand in awe of Him, all you offspring of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives)!</p>

<p><b>24</b> For He has not despised or abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, and He has not hidden His face from him, but has heard, when he cried to Him.</p>

<p><b>25</b> From You comes my praise in the great congregation; my vows I will perform before those who fear Him.</p>

<p><b>26</b> The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek Him shall praise the LORD! May your hearts live forever!</p>

<p><b>27</b> All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, and all the families of the nations shall worship before You.</p>

<p><b>28</b> For kingship belongs to the LORD, and He rules over the nations.</p>

<p><b>29</b> All the prosperous of the earth eat and worship; before Him shall bow all who go down to the dust, even the one who could not keep himself alive.</p>

<p><b>30</b> Posterity shall serve Him; it shall be told of the Lord to the coming generation;</p>

<p><b>31</b> they shall come and proclaim His righteousness to a people yet unborn, that He has done it.</p>
