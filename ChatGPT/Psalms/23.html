<h1>Psalm 23</h1>

<p><strong>A Psalm of David (Dawid – Beloved).</strong></p>
<a href="../Commentary/Psalms/psalm23.html">Jesus as the fullfillment of this psalm.</a>
<p>
1 The LORD (YHWH – He is) is my shepherd; I shall not lack. <br>
2 He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside still waters. <br>
3 He restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for His name’s sake. <br>
4 Even though I walk through the valley of deep shadow, I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff—they comfort me. <br>
5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. <br>
6 Surely goodness and mercy shall pursue me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
