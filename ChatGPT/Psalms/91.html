    <h1>Psalm 91</h1>
	<a href="../Commentary/Psalms/psalm.91html">Jesus as the fullfillment of this psalm.</a>

    <p><strong>1</strong> He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High (Elyon – Most High) will rest in the shadow of the Almighty (Shaddai – All-Sufficient One).</p>

    <p><strong>2</strong> I will say of the LORD (YHWH – He is), “My refuge and my fortress, my God (Elohim – Mighty Ones), in whom I trust.”</p>

    <p><strong>3</strong> For He will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence.</p>

    <p><strong>4</strong> He will cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you will take refuge; His truth will be your shield and armor.</p>

    <p><strong>5</strong> You will not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day,</p>

    <p><strong>6</strong> nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.</p>

    <p><strong>7</strong> A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.</p>

    <p><strong>8</strong> You will only look with your eyes and see the recompense of the wicked.</p>

    <p><strong>9</strong> Because you have made the LORD (YHWH – He is) your refuge, the Most High (Elyon – Most High) your dwelling place,</p>

    <p><strong>10</strong> no evil will befall you, nor will any plague come near your tent.</p>

    <p><strong>11</strong> For He will command His angels concerning you, to guard you in all your ways.</p>

    <p><strong>12</strong> They will lift you up in their hands, so that you do not strike your foot against a stone.</p>

    <p><strong>13</strong> You will tread on the lion and the cobra; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot.</p>

    <p><strong>14</strong> “Because he has set his love on Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him on high, because he knows My name.</p>

    <p><strong>15</strong> He will call on Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him.</p>

    <p><strong>16</strong> With long life I will satisfy him, and show him My salvation.”</p>
