    <h1>Psalm 1</h1>
<a href="../Commentary/Psalms/psalm1.html">New Testament Reflection/Fulfillment</a>
    <p><strong>1</strong> Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers.</p>

    <p><strong>2</strong> But his delight is in the Torah of the LORD (YHWH – He is), and on His Torah he meditates day and night.</p>

    <p><strong>3</strong> He will be like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither; and in all that he does, he prospers.</p>

    <p><strong>4</strong> The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away.</p>

    <p><strong>5</strong> Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</p>

    <p><strong>6</strong> For the LORD (YHWH – He is) knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.</p>
