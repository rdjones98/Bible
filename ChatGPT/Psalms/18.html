<h1>Psalm 18</h1>
<p>For the music director. Of David (Dawid – Beloved), the servant of the LORD (YHWH – He is), who spoke to the LORD the words of this song on the day the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul (Sha'ul – Asked For). He said:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> I love You, O LORD (YHWH – He is), my strength.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my rock in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> The cords of death encompassed me; torrents of destruction terrified me.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> The cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death confronted me.</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> In my distress I called upon the LORD; to my God I cried for help. From His temple He heard my voice, and my cry before Him reached His ears.</p>

<p><strong>7.</strong> Then the earth shook and quaked; the foundations of the mountains trembled and were shaken because He was angry.</p>

<p><strong>8.</strong> Smoke went up from His nostrils, and devouring fire from His mouth; glowing coals blazed forth from Him.</p>

<p><strong>9.</strong> He bent the heavens and came down; thick darkness was under His feet.</p>

<p><strong>10.</strong> He rode on a cherub and flew; He soared on the wings of the wind.</p>

<p><strong>11.</strong> He made darkness His covering, His canopy around Him—dark waters, thick clouds of the skies.</p>

<p><strong>12.</strong> Out of the brightness before Him passed hailstones and coals of fire.</p>

<p><strong>13.</strong> The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High gave forth His voice—hailstones and coals of fire.</p>

<p><strong>14.</strong> He sent out His arrows and scattered them; He hurled lightning and routed them.</p>

<p><strong>15.</strong> Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare at Your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.</p>

<p><strong>16.</strong> He reached down from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters.</p>

<p><strong>17.</strong> He delivered me from my powerful enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.</p>

<p><strong>18.</strong> They confronted me on the day of my disaster, but the LORD was my support.</p>

<p><strong>19.</strong> He brought me out into a broad place; He rescued me because He delighted in me.</p>

<p><strong>20.</strong> The LORD dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands He repaid me.</p>

<p><strong>21.</strong> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly turned from my God.</p>

<p><strong>22.</strong> For all His judgments were before me, and His statutes I did not turn away from.</p>

<p><strong>23.</strong> I was blameless before Him, and I kept myself from iniquity.</p>

<p><strong>24.</strong> So the LORD repaid me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in His sight.</p>

<p><strong>25.</strong> With the faithful You show Yourself faithful; with the blameless You show Yourself blameless;</p>

<p><strong>26.</strong> With the pure You show Yourself pure; and with the crooked You make Yourself seem shrewd.</p>

<p><strong>27.</strong> For You save a humble people, but haughty eyes You bring down.</p>

<p><strong>28.</strong> For You light my lamp; the LORD my God illumines my darkness.</p>

<p><strong>29.</strong> For by You I can run against a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall.</p>

<p><strong>30.</strong> This God—His way is perfect; the word of the LORD proves true; He is a shield for all who take refuge in Him.</p>

<p><strong>31.</strong> For who is God but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?</p>

<p><strong>32.</strong> The God who girds me with strength and makes my way blameless;</p>

<p><strong>33.</strong> He makes my feet like the feet of a deer and sets me secure on the heights.</p>

<p><strong>34.</strong> He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.</p>

<p><strong>35.</strong> You have given me the shield of Your salvation; Your right hand has supported me, and Your gentleness made me great.</p>

<p><strong>36.</strong> You gave a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip.</p>

<p><strong>37.</strong> I pursued my enemies and overtook them, and did not turn back until they were consumed.</p>

<p><strong>38.</strong> I struck them down so they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet.</p>

<p><strong>39.</strong> For You girded me with strength for battle; You made those who rose against me sink under me.</p>

<p><strong>40.</strong> You made my enemies turn their backs to me, and I destroyed those who hated me.</p>

<p><strong>41.</strong> They cried for help, but there was none to save; to the LORD, but He did not answer them.</p>

<p><strong>42.</strong> I beat them fine as dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets.</p>

<p><strong>43.</strong> You delivered me from the strife of the people; You made me the head of the nations; people I had not known served me.</p>

<p><strong>44.</strong> As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me; foreigners came cringing to me.</p>

<p><strong>45.</strong> Foreigners lost heart and came trembling out of their fortresses.</p>

<p><strong>46.</strong> The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock, and may the God of my salvation be exalted—</p>

<p><strong>47.</strong> the God who gave me vengeance and subdued peoples under me,</p>

<p><strong>48.</strong> who delivered me from my enemies; indeed, You exalted me above those who rose against me; You rescued me from the violent man.</p>

<p><strong>49.</strong> Therefore I will give thanks to You, O LORD, among the nations, and sing praises to Your name.</p>

<p><strong>50.</strong> Great salvation He gives to His king, and shows steadfast love to His anointed, to David (Dawid – Beloved) and his offspring forever.</p>
