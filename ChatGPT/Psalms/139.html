<p><b>Psalm 139</b></p>

<p><b>1</b> O LORD (YHWH – He is), You have searched me and known me.</p>

<p><b>2</b> You know when I sit down and when I rise up; You understand my thoughts from afar.</p>

<p><b>3</b> You sift my path and my lying down, and are intimately acquainted with all my ways.</p>

<p><b>4</b> Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, O LORD, You know it completely.</p>

<p><b>5</b> You hem me in behind and before, and You lay Your hand upon me.</p>

<p><b>6</b> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is too high—I cannot attain it.</p>

<p><b>7</b> Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?</p>

<p><b>8</b> If I ascend to the heavens, You are there. If I make my bed in Sheol (She'ol – the grave), behold, You are there.</p>

<p><b>9</b> If I take the wings of the dawn and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,</p>

<p><b>10</b> Even there Your hand will lead me, and Your right hand will hold me fast.</p>

<p><b>11</b> If I say, “Surely darkness will cover me,” even the night will be light around me.</p>

<p><b>12</b> Even darkness is not dark to You, and night shines like the day; darkness and light are alike to You.</p>

<p><b>13</b> For You formed my inward parts; You wove me together in my mother’s womb.</p>

<p><b>14</b> I praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are Your works—my soul knows it very well.</p>

<p><b>15</b> My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in secret, and skillfully woven in the depths of the earth.</p>

<p><b>16</b> Your eyes saw my unformed substance, and in Your book were written all the days that were formed for me, before one of them came to be.</p>

<p><b>17</b> How precious to me are Your thoughts, O God (Elohim – Mighty Ones)! How vast is the sum of them!</p>

<p><b>18</b> If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand. When I awake, I am still with You.</p>

<p><b>19</b> O that You would slay the wicked, O God (Elohim – Mighty Ones)! Depart from me, you bloodthirsty men!</p>

<p><b>20</b> They speak of You with evil intent; Your enemies take Your name in vain.</p>

<p><b>21</b> Do I not hate those who hate You, O LORD? And do I not loathe those who rise up against You?</p>

<p><b>22</b> I hate them with complete hatred; I count them my enemies.</p>

<p><b>23</b> Search me, O God (Elohim – Mighty Ones), and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.</p>

<p><b>24</b> See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way.</p>
