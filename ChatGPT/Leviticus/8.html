    <h1>Leviticus 8</h1>
    <p><strong>1.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) spoke to Moses (Drawn Out), saying,</p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> “Take Aaron (Light Bringer) and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread.”</p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> “And assemble all the congregation at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.”</p>
    <p><strong>4.</strong> And Moses did as the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) commanded him, and the congregation was assembled at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.</p>
    <p><strong>5.</strong> And Moses said to the congregation, “This is the thing that the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) has commanded to be done.”</p>
    <p><strong>6.</strong> And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.</p>
    <p><strong>7.</strong> And he put upon him the tunic, and girded him with the sash, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the belt of the ephod, and bound it to him with it.</p>
    <p><strong>8.</strong> And he placed upon him the breastplate, and in the breastplate he put the Urim (Lights) and the Thummim (Perfections).</p>
    <p><strong>9.</strong> And he set the turban upon his head, and upon the turban, in front, he set the golden plate, the holy crown, as the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) commanded Moses.</p>
    <p><strong>10.</strong> And Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the Tabernacle and all that was in it, and sanctified them.</p>
    <p><strong>11.</strong> And he sprinkled some of it upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its base, to sanctify them.</p>
    <p><strong>12.</strong> And he poured some of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s (Light Bringer's) head and anointed him to sanctify him.</p>
    <p><strong>13.</strong> And Moses brought Aaron’s (Light Bringer's) sons and clothed them with tunics, and girded them with sashes, and bound caps on them, as the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) commanded Moses.</p>
    <p><strong>14.</strong> And he brought near the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bull of the sin offering.</p>
    <p><strong>15.</strong> And he slaughtered it, and Moses took the blood and put it on the horns of the altar all around with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it to make atonement for it.</p>
    <p><strong>16.</strong> And he took all the fat that was upon the entrails, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses burned them upon the altar.</p>
    <p><strong>17.</strong> But the bull, its hide, and its flesh, and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) commanded Moses.</p>
    <p><strong>18.</strong> And he brought near the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.</p>
    <p><strong>19.</strong> And he slaughtered it, and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar all around.</p>
    <p><strong>20.</strong> And he cut the ram into its pieces, and Moses burned the head, and the pieces, and the fat.</p>
    <p><strong>21.</strong> And he washed the entrails and the legs with water, and Moses burned the whole ram upon the altar. It was a burnt offering for a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists), as the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) commanded Moses.</p>
    <p><strong>22.</strong> And he brought near the second ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.</p>
    <p><strong>23.</strong> And he slaughtered it, and Moses took some of its blood and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s (Light Bringer's) right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the big toe of his right foot.</p>
    <p><strong>24.</strong> And he brought near Aaron’s (Light Bringer's) sons, and Moses put some of the blood upon the tip of their right ears, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the big toes of their right feet. And Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar all around.</p>
    <p><strong>25.</strong> And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was upon the entrails, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh.</p>
    <p><strong>26.</strong> And from the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists), he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them upon the fat and upon the right thigh.</p>
    <p><strong>27.</strong> And he placed them all upon the palms of Aaron and upon the palms of his sons, and waved them as a wave offering before the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists).</p>
    <p><strong>28.</strong> And Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar upon the burnt offering. They were an ordination offering for a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists).</p>
    <p><strong>29.</strong> And Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering before the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists). It was Moses’ (Drawn Out's) portion of the ram of ordination, as the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) commanded Moses.</p>
    <p><strong>30.</strong> And Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it upon Aaron and upon his garments, and upon his sons and upon his sons’ garments with him, and he sanctified Aaron and his garments, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.</p>
