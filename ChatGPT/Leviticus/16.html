    <h1>Leviticus 16</h1>
    <p><strong>1.</strong> And the LORD (YHWH – He is) spoke to Moses (Drawn Out) after the death of the two sons of Aaron (Light Bringer), when they drew near before the LORD (YHWH – He is) and died.</p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> And the LORD (YHWH – He is) said to Moses, “Speak to Aaron your brother, that he not come at all times into the Holy Place inside the veil, before the mercy seat which is upon the ark, so that he does not die. For I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.”</p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> “With this shall Aaron come into the Holy Place: with a bull of the herd for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.”</p>
    <p><strong>4.</strong> “He shall put on a holy linen tunic, and linen trousers shall be upon his flesh, and he shall gird himself with a linen sash, and with a linen turban he shall be attired. These are holy garments; and he shall bathe his flesh in water and put them on.”</p>
    <p><strong>5.</strong> “And from the congregation of the sons of Israel (God Strives) he shall take two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.”</p>
    <p><strong>6.</strong> “And Aaron shall bring near the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house.”</p>
    <p><strong>7.</strong> “And he shall take the two goats and set them before the LORD (YHWH – He is) at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.”</p>
    <p><strong>8.</strong> “And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats: one lot for the LORD (YHWH – He is) and one lot for Azazel (Goat of Departure - Scapegoat).”</p>
    <p><strong>9.</strong> “And Aaron shall bring near the goat upon which the lot for the LORD (YHWH – He is) fell, and offer it as a sin offering.”</p>
    <p><strong>10.</strong> “But the goat on which the lot for Azazel (Goat of Departure) fell shall be presented alive before the LORD (YHWH – He is), to make atonement upon it, to send it away for Azazel (Goat of Departure) into the wilderness.”</p>
    <p><strong>11.</strong> “And Aaron shall bring near the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house, and shall slaughter the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself.”</p>
    <p><strong>12.</strong> “And he shall take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the LORD (YHWH – He is), and his hands full of finely ground sweet incense, and bring it inside the veil.”</p>
    <p><strong>13.</strong> “And he shall place the incense upon the fire before the LORD (YHWH – He is), and the cloud of incense shall cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, so that he does not die.”</p>
    <p><strong>14.</strong> “And he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat on the east side, and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.”</p>
    <p><strong>15.</strong> “And he shall slaughter the goat of the sin offering, which is for the people, and bring its blood inside the veil, and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat.”</p>
    <p><strong>16.</strong> “And he shall make atonement for the Holy Place because of the impurities of the sons of Israel (God Strives) and because of their transgressions in all their sins. And so shall he do for the Tent of Meeting, which dwells with them in the midst of their impurities.”</p>
    <p><strong>17.</strong> “And no man shall be in the Tent of Meeting when he enters to make atonement in the Holy Place until he comes out, and he shall make atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel (God Strives).”</p>
    <p><strong>18.</strong> “And he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD (YHWH – He is) and make atonement for it, and he shall take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar all around.”</p>
    <p><strong>19.</strong> “And he shall sprinkle some of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and sanctify it from the impurities of the sons of Israel (God Strives).”</p>
    <p><strong>20.</strong> “And when he has finished atoning for the Holy Place, and the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he shall bring near the live goat.”</p>
    <p><strong>21.</strong> “And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities of the sons of Israel (God Strives) and all their transgressions in all their sins, and put them upon the head of the goat, and send it away by the hand of a designated man into the wilderness.”</p>
    <p><strong>22.</strong> “And the goat shall bear upon itself all their iniquities to a land cut off, and he shall send the goat into the wilderness.”</p>
