    <h1>Leviticus 17</h1>
    <p><strong>1.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) spoke to Moses (Drawn Out), saying,</p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> “Speak to Aaron (Light Bringer) and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel (God Strives), and say to them: This is the thing which the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) has commanded, saying:</p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> Any man from the house of Israel (God Strives) who slaughters a bull, or a lamb, or a goat in the camp, or who slaughters it outside the camp,</p>
    <p><strong>4.</strong> and does not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to offer it as an offering to the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) before the Tabernacle of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists), bloodguilt shall be counted to that man—he has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people.</p>
    <p><strong>5.</strong> So that the sons of Israel (God Strives) bring their sacrifices that they slaughter in the open field, and bring them to the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, to the priest, and slaughter them as sacrifices of peace offerings to the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists).</p>
    <p><strong>6.</strong> And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and burn the fat for a pleasing aroma to the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists).</p>
    <p><strong>7.</strong> And they shall no longer offer their sacrifices to the goat demons after whom they stray. This shall be a statute forever to them throughout their generations.</p>
    <p><strong>8.</strong> And you shall say to them: Any man from the house of Israel (God Strives) or from the strangers who sojourn among them who offers a burnt offering or a sacrifice,</p>
    <p><strong>9.</strong> and does not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to offer it to the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists), that man shall be cut off from his people.</p>
    <p><strong>10.</strong> And any man from the house of Israel (God Strives) or from the strangers who sojourn among them who eats any blood, I will set My face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from among his people.</p>
    <p><strong>11.</strong> For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul.</p>
    <p><strong>12.</strong> Therefore I said to the sons of Israel (God Strives): No soul of you shall eat blood, nor shall the stranger who sojourns among you eat blood.</p>
    <p><strong>13.</strong> And any man from the sons of Israel (God Strives) or from the strangers who sojourn among them who hunts and catches any animal or bird that may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with dust.</p>
    <p><strong>14.</strong> For the life of all flesh is its blood; it is its life. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel (God Strives): You shall not eat the blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats it shall be cut off.</p>
    <p><strong>15.</strong> And any person who eats what dies of itself or what is torn by beasts, whether he is native or a stranger, he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening; then he shall be clean.</p>
    <p><strong>16.</strong> But if he does not wash and does not bathe his flesh, he shall bear his iniquity.”</p>
