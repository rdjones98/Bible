    <h1>Leviticus 9</h1>
    <p><strong>1.</strong> And it was on the eighth day, Moses (Drawn Out) called Aaron (Light Bringer) and his sons, and the elders of Israel (God Strives).</p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> And he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a bull calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, perfect ones, and bring them before the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists).”</p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> “And speak to the sons of Israel (God Strives), saying: Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, yearlings, perfect ones, for a burnt offering.”</p>
    <p><strong>4.</strong> “And a bull and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists), and a grain offering mixed with oil, for today the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) appears to you.”</p>
    <p><strong>5.</strong> And they brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists).</p>
    <p><strong>6.</strong> And Moses said, “This is the thing that the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) commanded you to do, and the glory of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) will appear to you.”</p>
    <p><strong>7.</strong> And Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar and prepare your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people. And prepare the offering of the people and make atonement for them, as the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) commanded.”</p>
    <p><strong>8.</strong> And Aaron drew near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.</p>
    <p><strong>9.</strong> And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured the blood at the base of the altar.</p>
    <p><strong>10.</strong> And the fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar, as the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) commanded Moses.</p>
    <p><strong>11.</strong> And the flesh and the hide he burned with fire outside the camp.</p>
    <p><strong>12.</strong> And he slaughtered the burnt offering, and the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he sprinkled it upon the altar all around.</p>
    <p><strong>13.</strong> And they presented the burnt offering to him in its pieces, and the head, and he burned them on the altar.</p>
    <p><strong>14.</strong> And he washed the entrails and the legs and burned them upon the burnt offering on the altar.</p>
    <p><strong>15.</strong> And he brought near the offering of the people, and took the goat of the sin offering, which was for the people, and slaughtered it, and made it a sin offering like the first.</p>
    <p><strong>16.</strong> And he brought near the burnt offering and prepared it according to the regulation.</p>
    <p><strong>17.</strong> And he brought near the grain offering and filled his palm with it and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.</p>
    <p><strong>18.</strong> And he slaughtered the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people, and the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he sprinkled it upon the altar all around.</p>
    <p><strong>19.</strong> And the fat from the bull and from the ram, the fat tail, and the covering fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver.</p>
    <p><strong>20.</strong> And they placed the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat upon the altar.</p>
    <p><strong>21.</strong> And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved as a wave offering before the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists), as Moses commanded.</p>
    <p><strong>22.</strong> And Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he came down from preparing the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.</p>
    <p><strong>23.</strong> And Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and they came out and blessed the people, and the glory of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) appeared to all the people.</p>
    <p><strong>24.</strong> And fire went out from before the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar, and all the people saw and shouted and fell on their faces.</p>
