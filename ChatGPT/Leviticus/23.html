    <h1>Leviticus 23</h1>
    
    <p><strong>1.</strong> And YHWH (He Exists) spoke to Moses (Drawn Out), saying:</p>
    
    <p><strong>2.</strong> Speak to the sons of Israel (God Strives) and say to them: The appointed times of YHWH (He Exists), which you shall proclaim, holy convocations—they are My appointed times.</p>
    
    <p><strong>3.</strong> Six days shall work be done, and on the seventh day is a Sabbath (Shabbat, Ceasing) of rest, a holy convocation; you shall not do any work—it is a Sabbath (Shabbat, Ceasing) to YHWH (He Exists) in all your dwellings.</p>
    
    <p><strong>4.</strong> These are the appointed times of YHWH (He Exists), holy convocations, which you shall proclaim at their appointed times:</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.</strong> In the first month, on the fourteenth of the month, between the evenings, is Passover to YHWH (He Exists).</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.</strong> And on the fifteenth day of this month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to YHWH (He Exists); seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.</p>
    
    <p><strong>7.</strong> On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work.</p>
    
    <p><strong>8.</strong> And you shall bring near an offering made by fire to YHWH (He Exists) for seven days. On the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work.</p>
    
    <p><strong>9.</strong> And YHWH (He Exists) spoke to Moses (Drawn Out), saying:</p>
    
    <p><strong>10.</strong> Speak to the sons of Israel (God Strives) and say to them: When you come into the land that I give to you and reap its harvest, you shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest.</p>
    
    <p><strong>11.</strong> And he shall wave the sheaf before YHWH (He Exists) for acceptance for you; on the day after the Sabbath (Shabbat, Ceasing) the priest shall wave it.</p>
    
    <p><strong>12.</strong> And on the day you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a perfect male lamb of the first year as a burnt offering to YHWH (He Exists).</p>
    
    <p><strong>13.</strong> And its grain offering shall be two-tenths of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering made by fire to YHWH (He Exists), a soothing aroma; and its drink offering shall be wine, a fourth of a hin.</p>
    
    <p><strong>14.</strong> And you shall not eat bread, roasted grain, or fresh grain until this very day, until you have brought the offering of your God (Elohim, Mighty One); it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</p>
    
    <p><strong>15.</strong> And you shall count for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath (Shabbat, Ceasing), from the day you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, seven complete Sabbaths (Shabbatot, Ceasings) shall be.</p>
    
    <p><strong>16.</strong> Until the day after the seventh Sabbath (Shabbat, Ceasing), you shall count fifty days, and you shall bring a new grain offering to YHWH (He Exists).</p>
    
    <p><strong>17.</strong> From your dwellings, you shall bring two wave loaves of two-tenths; they shall be of fine flour, baked with leaven, firstfruits to YHWH (He Exists).</p>
    
    <p><strong>18.</strong> And you shall bring with the bread seven perfect lambs of the first year, and one young bull, and two rams; they shall be a burnt offering to YHWH (He Exists), with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering made by fire, a soothing aroma to YHWH (He Exists).</p>
    
    <p><strong>19.</strong> And you shall offer one male goat as a sin offering, and two male lambs of the first year as a peace offering.</p>
    
    <p><strong>20.</strong> And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave offering before YHWH (He Exists), with the two lambs; they shall be holy to YHWH (He Exists) for the priest.</p>
    
    <p><strong>21.</strong> And you shall proclaim on this very day, it shall be a holy convocation for you; you shall not do any laborious work. It is a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.</p>
    
    <p><strong>22.</strong> And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely reap the corners of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest; you shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner. I am YHWH (He Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty One).</p>
    
    <p><strong>23.</strong> And YHWH (He Exists) spoke to Moses (Drawn Out), saying:</p>
    
    <p><strong>24.</strong> Speak to the sons of Israel (God Strives), saying: In the seventh month, on the first of the month, you shall have a Sabbath (Shabbat, Ceasing), a memorial of blasting, a holy convocation.</p>
    
    <p><strong>25.</strong> You shall do no laborious work, and you shall bring near an offering made by fire to YHWH (He Exists).</p>
    
    <p><strong>26.</strong> And YHWH (He Exists) spoke to Moses (Drawn Out), saying:</p>
    
    <p><strong>27.</strong> Indeed, on the tenth of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement; it shall be a holy convocation for you, and you shall afflict your souls, and bring near an offering made by fire to YHWH (He Exists).</p>
    
    <p><strong>28.</strong> And you shall do no work on this very day, for it is the Day of Atonement, to make atonement for you before YHWH (He Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty One).</p>
    
    <p><strong>29.</strong> For any soul that is not afflicted on this very day shall be cut off from its people.</p>
    
    <p><strong>30.</strong> And any soul that does any work on this very day, I will destroy that soul from among its people.</p>
    
    <p><strong>31.</strong> You shall do no work—a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</p>
    
    <p><strong>32.</strong> It is a Sabbath (Shabbat, Ceasing) of rest for you, and you shall afflict your souls. On the ninth of the month in the evening, from evening to evening, you shall keep your Sabbath (Shabbat, Ceasing).</p>
    
    <p><strong>33.</strong> And YHWH (He Exists) spoke to Moses (Drawn Out), saying:</p>
    
    <p><strong>34.</strong> Speak to the sons of Israel (God Strives), saying: On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the Feast of Booths for seven days to YHWH (He Exists).</p>
    
    <p><strong>35.</strong> On the first day is a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work.</p>
    
    <p><strong>36.</strong> For seven days you shall bring an offering made by fire to YHWH (He Exists). On the eighth day, you shall have a holy convocation and bring an offering made by fire to YHWH (He Exists). It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no laborious work.</p>
    
    <p><strong>37.</strong> These are the appointed times of YHWH (He Exists), which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire to YHWH (He Exists)—a burnt offering, a grain offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, each on its day—</p>
    
    <p><strong>38.</strong> besides the Sabbaths (Shabbatot, Ceasings) of YHWH (He Exists), and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill offerings that you give to YHWH (He Exists).</p>
    
    <p><strong>39.</strong> Indeed, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered the produce of the land, you shall keep the feast of YHWH (He Exists) for seven days. On the first day shall be a Sabbath (Shabbat, Ceasing), and on the eighth day shall be a Sabbath (Shabbat, Ceasing).</p>
    
    <p><strong>40.</strong> And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palm trees, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before YHWH (He Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty One) for seven days.</p>
    
    <p><strong>41.</strong> And you shall keep it as a feast to YHWH (He Exists) for seven days in the year—a statute forever throughout your generations. In the seventh month, you shall keep it.</p>
    
    <p><strong>42.</strong> You shall dwell in booths for seven days; all the native-born in Israel (God Strives) shall dwell in booths,</p>
    
    <p><strong>43.</strong> so that your generations may know that I made the sons of Israel (God Strives) dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt (Mitzrayim, Narrow Place). I am YHWH (He Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty One).</p>
    
    <p><strong>44.</strong> And Moses (Drawn Out) spoke of the appointed times of YHWH (He Exists) to the sons of Israel (God Strives).</p>
