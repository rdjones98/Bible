<div class='std-text'> <p class="chapter-2"><span id="en-NIV-1508" class="text Gen-50-1"><span class="chapternum">50 </span>Joseph threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1509" class="text Gen-50-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1510" class="text Gen-50-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>taking a full forty days, for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1511" class="text Gen-50-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>When the days of mourning
 had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh’s court,
 “If I have found favor in your eyes,
 speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him,</span> <span id="en-NIV-1512" class="text Gen-50-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>‘My father made me swear an oath
 and said, “I am about to die;
 bury me in the tomb I dug for myself
 in the land of Canaan.”
 Now let me go up and bury my father;
 then I will return.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1513" class="text Gen-50-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1514" class="text Gen-50-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh’s officials
 accompanied him—the dignitaries of his court
 and all the dignitaries of Egypt—</span> <span id="en-NIV-1515" class="text Gen-50-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>besides all the members of Joseph’s household and his brothers and those belonging to his father’s household.
 Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1516" class="text Gen-50-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Chariots
 and horsemen<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1516a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1516a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1516a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> also went up with him. It was a very large company.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1517" class="text Gen-50-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>When they reached the threshing floor
 of Atad, near the Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly;
 and there Joseph observed a seven-day period
 of mourning
 for his father.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1518" class="text Gen-50-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>When the Canaanites
 who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning.”
 That is why that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1518b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1518b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1518b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1519" class="text Gen-50-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>So Jacob’s sons did as he had commanded them:
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1520" class="text Gen-50-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah,
 near Mamre,
 which Abraham had bought along with the field
 as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1521" class="text Gen-50-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father.
</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-1522" class="text Gen-50-15">Joseph Reassures His Brothers</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-50-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph holds a grudge
 against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1523" class="text Gen-50-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>So they sent word to Joseph, saying, “Your father left these instructions
 before he died:</span> <span id="en-NIV-1524" class="text Gen-50-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>‘This is what you are to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins
 and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.’
 Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father.
” When their message came to him, Joseph wept.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1525" class="text Gen-50-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him.
 “We are your slaves,”
 they said.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1526" class="text Gen-50-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>But Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God?
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1527" class="text Gen-50-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>You intended to harm me,
 but God intended
 it for good
 to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1528" class="text Gen-50-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>So then, don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your children.
” And he reassured them and spoke kindly
 to them.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-1529" class="text Gen-50-22">The Death of Joseph</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-50-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father’s family. He lived a hundred and ten years
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1530" class="text Gen-50-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>and saw the third generation
 of Ephraim’s
 children.
 Also the children of Makir
 son of Manasseh
 were placed at birth on Joseph’s knees.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1530c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1530c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1530c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1531" class="text Gen-50-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die.
 But God will surely come to your aid
 and take you up out of this land to the land
 he promised on oath to Abraham,
 Isaac
 and Jacob.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1532" class="text Gen-50-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath
 and said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones
 up from this place.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1533" class="text Gen-50-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>So Joseph died
 at the age of a hundred and ten.
 And after they embalmed him,
 he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.</span></p> </div><div class='il-text'></div><div class="footnotes">
