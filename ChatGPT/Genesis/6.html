 any of them they chose.</span> <span id="en-NIV-141" class="text Gen-6-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “My Spirit

 were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans
