  <h1>Genesis 4</h1>

  <p><strong>1</strong> And the man knew Eve (Life) his wife; and she conceived and bore Cain (Acquired), and said, "I have acquired a man with the Lord (YHWH - He is)."</p>
  <p><strong>2</strong> And she again bore his brother, Abel (Breath/Vanity). And Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain was a worker of the ground.</p>
  <p><strong>3</strong> And it came to pass, at the end of days, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the Lord.</p>
  <p><strong>4</strong> And Abel, he also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the Lord had regard for Abel and his offering,</p>
  <p><strong>5</strong> But for Cain and for his offering He did not have regard. And Cain was very angry, and his face fell.</p>
  <p><strong>6</strong> And the Lord said to Cain, "Why are you angry? And why has your face fallen?</p>
  <p><strong>7</strong> If you do well, will there not be lifting up? But if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its desire is for you, but you must rule over it."</p>
  <p><strong>8</strong> And Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.</p>
  <p><strong>9</strong> And the Lord said to Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?" And he said, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?"</p>
  <p><strong>10</strong> And He said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to Me from the ground.</p>
  <p><strong>11</strong> And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.</p>
  <p><strong>12</strong> When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth."</p>
  <p><strong>13</strong> And Cain said to the Lord, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.</p>
  <p><strong>14</strong> Behold, You have driven me today away from the face of the ground, and from Your face I shall be hidden. And I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."</p>
  <p><strong>15</strong> And the Lord said to him, "Therefore, whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold." And the Lord set a mark on Cain, lest anyone finding him should strike him.</p>
  <p><strong>16</strong> And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and settled in the land of Nod (Wandering), east of Eden (Delight).</p>
  <p><strong>17</strong> And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch (Dedicated). And he built a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch (Dedicated).</p>
  <p><strong>18</strong> And to Enoch was born Irad (Fugitive), and Irad fathered Mehujael (Smitten of God), and Mehujael fathered Methushael (Man of God), and Methushael fathered Lamech (Powerful).</p>
  <p><strong>19</strong> And Lamech took two wives: the name of the one was Adah (Adornment), and the name of the second was Zillah (Shade).</p>
  <p><strong>20</strong> And Adah bore Jabal (Stream/Move), he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.</p>
  <p><strong>21</strong> And the name of his brother was Jubal (Sound/Stream), he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.</p>
  <p><strong>22</strong> And Zillah also bore Tubal-cain (Offspring of Smith), forger of every tool of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah (Pleasant).</p>
  <p><strong>23</strong> And Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lamech, give ear to my speech! For I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.</p>
  <p><strong>24</strong> If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold."</p>
  <p><strong>25</strong> And Adam (Man) knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth (Appointed), for she said, "God (Elohim) has appointed for me another offspring instead of Abel, because Cain killed him."</p>
  <p><strong>26</strong> And to Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh (Mortal/Man). Then began to call on the name of the Lord.</p>
