<h1>Genesis 4</h1>

<p><sup>1</sup>Now Adam (Adam – Human) knew his wife Eve (Chavah – Life), and she conceived and bore Cain (Qayin – Acquired), and said, “I have acquired a man with the help of the LORD (YHWH – He is).”</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Then she bore again, his brother Abel (Hevel – Breath, Vapor). Now Abel was a keeper of flocks, but Cain was a worker of the ground.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>And in the course of time, Cain brought an offering to the LORD of the fruit of the ground,</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>and Abel also brought from the firstborn of his flock and from their fat portions. And the LORD regarded Abel and his offering,</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>but He did not regard Cain and his offering. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>Then the LORD said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen?</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.”</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>Then the LORD said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” He said, “I do not know; am I my brother’s keeper?”</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>And He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying to Me from the ground.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>So now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>Behold, You have driven me this day away from the ground, and from Your face I shall be hidden. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>Then the LORD said to him, “Not so! If anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.” And the LORD set a mark on Cain, so that no one who found him would strike him.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>Then Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod (Nod – Wandering), east of Eden.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch (Chanokh – Dedicated). And he built a city, and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch (Chanokh – Dedicated).</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>To Enoch was born Irad (Irad – Fugitive), and Irad fathered Mehujael (Mechuya’el – Smitten by God), and Mehujael fathered Methushael (Metusha’el – Man of God), and Methushael fathered Lamech (Lemekh – Powerful or Wild).</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>Lamech took two wives. The name of the one was Adah (Adah – Ornament), and the name of the other Zillah (Tzillah – Shade or Shadow).</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>Adah bore Jabal (Yaval – Stream or Wanderer); he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>His brother’s name was Jubal (Yuval – Ram’s horn or Stream); he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>Zillah also bore Tubal-cain (Tuval-Qayin – Smith of Cain), a forger of every cutting tool of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah (Na’amah – Pleasant).</p>
