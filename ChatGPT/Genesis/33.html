  <h1>Genesis 33</h1>
<img src=33.png></img>
  <p><strong>1</strong> <strong>Jacob (Ya’akov – Heel-grabber, Supplanter)</strong> lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, <strong>Esau (Esav – Hairy)</strong> was coming, and with him were four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, <strong>Rachel (Rachel – Ewe)</strong>, and the two female servants.</p>

  <p><strong>2</strong> He put the female servants and their children in front, <strong>Leah (Le’ah – Weary)</strong> and her children behind them, and Rachel and <strong>Joseph (Yosef – He adds)</strong> at the rear.</p>

  <p><strong>3</strong> He himself passed before them and bowed to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</p>

  <p><strong>4</strong> Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, and kissed him, and they wept.</p>

  <p><strong>5</strong> When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he said, “Who are these with you?” Jacob said, “The children whom <strong>God (Elohim – God, Mighty One)</strong> has graciously given your servant.”</p>

  <p><strong>6</strong> Then the female servants came near, they and their children, and bowed down.</p>

  <p><strong>7</strong> Leah also came near with her children, and they bowed down. Afterward Joseph and Rachel came near, and they bowed down.</p>

  <p><strong>8</strong> Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company that I met?” Jacob said, “To find favor in the eyes of my lord.”</p>

  <p><strong>9</strong> Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.”</p>

  <p><strong>10</strong> But Jacob said, “No, please! If I have now found favor in your eyes, then receive my gift from my hand. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, and you have received me favorably.</p>

  <p><strong>11</strong> Please take the blessing that has been brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” And he urged him, and he took it.</p>

  <p><strong>12</strong> Then Esau said, “Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go ahead of you.”</p>

  <p><strong>13</strong> But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and that the flocks and herds which are nursing are with me. If they are driven hard for one day, all the flock will die.</p>

  <p><strong>14</strong> Please let my lord go ahead of his servant, and I will move on slowly at the pace of the livestock before me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord at <strong>Seir (Se’ir – Hairy or Rugged)</strong>.”</p>

  <p><strong>15</strong> Esau said, “Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But Jacob said, “Why? Let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.”</p>

  <p><strong>16</strong> So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.</p>

  <p><strong>17</strong> But Jacob traveled to <strong>Sukkoth (Sukkot – Booths)</strong>, and built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Sukkoth.</p>

  <p><strong>18</strong> Jacob came safely to the city of <strong>Shechem (Shekhem – Shoulder)</strong>, which is in the land of <strong>Canaan (Kena’an – Lowland)</strong>, when he came from <strong>Paddan-aram (Paddan Aram – Field of Aram)</strong>, and he pitched his tent before the city.</p>

  <p><strong>19</strong> He bought the piece of land where he had pitched his tent from the sons of <strong>Hamor (Chamor – Donkey)</strong>, father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver.</p>

  <p><strong>20</strong> There he set up an altar and called it <strong>El-Elohe-Israel (El Elohei Yisra’el – God, the God of Israel)</strong>.</p>
