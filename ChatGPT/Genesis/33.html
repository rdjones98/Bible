  <h1>Genesis 33</h1>

<img src=33.png></img>

<p><sup>1</sup>Jacob (Yaʿaqov – Supplanter) looked up and saw Esau (ʿEsav – Hairy) coming with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah (Leʾah – Weary), Rachel (Raḥel – Ewe), and the two female servants.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>He placed the female servants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph (Yosef – He Adds) last.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>He himself went on ahead and bowed to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>But Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him. And they wept.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he asked, “Who are these with you?”</p>

<p>Jacob answered, “They are the children God (Elohim – Mighty Ones) has graciously given your servant.”</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>Then the female servants and their children approached and bowed down.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>Esau asked, “What do you mean by all these droves I met?”</p>

<p>“To find favor in your eyes, my lord,” Jacob said.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>But Esau said, “I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself.”</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>“No, please!” said Jacob. “If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way; I'll accompany you.”</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir (Seʿir – Hairy).”</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>Esau said, “Then let me leave some of my men with you.”</p>

<p>“But why do that?” Jacob asked. “Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.”</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>Jacob, however, went to Succoth (Sukkot – Booths), where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Succoth.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem (Shekhem – Shoulder) in Canaan (Kenaʿan – Lowland) and camped within sight of the city.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>For a hundred pieces of silver, he bought from the sons of Hamor (Ḥamor – Donkey), the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel (El Elohei Yisraʾel – God, the God of Israel).</p>
