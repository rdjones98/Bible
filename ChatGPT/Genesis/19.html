 arrived at Sodom
 in the evening, and Lot
 was sitting in the gateway of the city.
 When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-460" class="text Gen-19-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>“My lords,” he said, “please turn aside to your servant’s house. You can wash your feet
 and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-19-2">“No,” they answered, “we will spend the night in the square.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-461" class="text Gen-19-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But he insisted
 so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house.
 He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast,
 and they ate.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-462" class="text Gen-19-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom
—both young and old—surrounded the house.</span> <span id="en-NIV-463" class="text Gen-19-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>They called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-464" class="text Gen-19-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Lot went outside to meet them
 and shut the door behind him</span> <span id="en-NIV-465" class="text Gen-19-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>and said, “No, my friends. Don’t do this wicked thing.</span> <span id="en-NIV-466" class="text Gen-19-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don’t do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-467" class="text Gen-19-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>“Get out of our way,” they replied. “This fellow came here as a foreigner,
 and now he wants to play the judge!
 We’ll treat you worse than them.” They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-468" class="text Gen-19-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>But the men
 inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door.</span> <span id="en-NIV-469" class="text Gen-19-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness
 so that they could not find the door.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-470" class="text Gen-19-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>The two men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you?
 Get them out of here,</span> <span id="en-NIV-471" class="text Gen-19-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>because we
 are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> against its people is so great
 that he has sent us to destroy it.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-472" class="text Gen-19-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-472a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-472a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-472a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> his daughters. He said, “Hurry and get out of this place, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is about to destroy the city!
” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-473" class="text Gen-19-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away
 when the city is punished.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-474" class="text Gen-19-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters
 and led them safely out of the city, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was merciful to them.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-475" class="text Gen-19-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, “Flee for your lives!
 Don’t look back,
 and don’t stop anywhere in the plain!
 Flee to the mountains
 or you will be swept away!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-476" class="text Gen-19-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>But Lot said to them, “No, my lords,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-476b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-476b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-476b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> please!</span> <span id="en-NIV-477" class="text Gen-19-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Your<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-477c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-477c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-477c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> servant has found favor in your<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-477d' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-477d&quot; title=&quot;See footnote d&quot;&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-477d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> eyes,
 and you<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-477e' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-477e&quot; title=&quot;See footnote e&quot;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-477e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> have shown great kindness
 to me in sparing my life. But I can’t flee to the mountains;
 this disaster will overtake me, and I’ll die.</span> <span id="en-NIV-478" class="text Gen-19-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it—it is very small, isn’t it? Then my life will be spared.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-479" class="text Gen-19-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>He said to him, “Very well, I will grant this request
 too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of.</span> <span id="en-NIV-480" class="text Gen-19-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.” (That is why the town was called Zoar.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-480f' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-480f&quot; title=&quot;See footnote f&quot;&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-480f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup>
)</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-481" class="text Gen-19-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>By the time Lot reached Zoar,
 the sun had risen over the land.</span> <span id="en-NIV-482" class="text Gen-19-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> rained down burning sulfur
 on Sodom and Gomorrah
—from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> out of the heavens.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-483" class="text Gen-19-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Thus he overthrew those cities
 and the entire plain,
 destroying all those living in the cities—and also the vegetation in the land.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-484" class="text Gen-19-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>But Lot’s wife looked back,
 and she became a pillar of salt.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-485" class="text Gen-19-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-486" class="text Gen-19-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-487" class="text Gen-19-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>So when God destroyed the cities of the plain,
 he remembered
 Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe
 that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.
</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-488" class="text Gen-19-30">Lot and His Daughters</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-19-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Lot and his two daughters left Zoar
 and settled in the mountains,
 for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave.</span> <span id="en-NIV-489" class="text Gen-19-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children—as is the custom all over the earth.</span> <span id="en-NIV-490" class="text Gen-19-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Let’s get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line
 through our father.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-491" class="text Gen-19-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-492" class="text Gen-19-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Last night I slept with my father. Let’s get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-493" class="text Gen-19-35"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>So they got their father to drink wine
 that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-494" class="text Gen-19-36"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>So both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-495" class="text Gen-19-37"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-495g' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-495g&quot; title=&quot;See footnote g&quot;&gt;g&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-495g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup>;
