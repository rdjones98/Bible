  <h1>Genesis 16</h1>

  <p><em>Note: The phrase "angel of YHWH" in this chapter is translated from the Hebrew "Mal'akh YHWH" (מַלְאַךְ יְהוָה), meaning "Messenger of YHWH." The word <strong>mal'akh</strong> means messenger and can refer to either a human or divine figure. In this context, it refers to a divine being who speaks on behalf of (or as) YHWH.</em></p>

  <p><strong>1</strong> And Sarai (Princess), wife of Abram (Exalted Father), had not borne to him, and she had a female servant, an Egyptian, and her name was Hagar (Flight).</p>
  <p><strong>2</strong> And Sarai said to Abram, "Behold now, the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) has restrained me from bearing. Please go in to my servant; perhaps I shall be built up through her." And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.</p>
  <p><strong>3</strong> And Sarai, wife of Abram, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan (Humbled), and gave her to her husband Abram as a wife.</p>
  <p><strong>4</strong> And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And she saw that she had conceived, and her mistress was despised in her eyes.</p>
  <p><strong>5</strong> And Sarai said to Abram, "My wrong be upon you! I gave my servant into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. May the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) judge between me and you."
  </p>
  <p><strong>6</strong> But Abram said to Sarai, "Behold, your servant is in your hand; do to her what is good in your eyes." And Sarai afflicted her, and she fled from her face.</p>
  <p><strong>7</strong> And the <a href="../Commentary/Angel of God.html">angel of the Lord (Mal'akh YHWH)</a> found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur (Wall).</p>
  <p><strong>8</strong> And he said, "Hagar (Flight), servant of Sarai, from where have you come and where are you going?" And she said, "I am fleeing from the face of Sarai my mistress."
  </p>
  <p><strong>9</strong> And the angel of the Lord said to her, "Return to your mistress and humble yourself under her hand."
  </p>
  <p><strong>10</strong> And the angel of the Lord said to her, "I will multiply your seed exceedingly, that it shall not be counted for multitude."
  </p>
  <p><strong>11</strong> And the angel of the Lord said to her, "Behold, you are pregnant and shall bear a son, and you shall call his name Ishmael (God Hears), because the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) has heard your affliction.</p>
  <p><strong>12</strong> And he shall be a wild man; his hand against all, and the hand of all against him; and he shall dwell in the face of all his brothers."
  </p>
  <p><strong>13</strong> And she called the name of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) who spoke to her, "You are <a href="../Commentary/Names of God.html">El Roi (God Who Sees)</a>," for she said, "Even here have I seen after Him who sees me?"
  </p>
  <p><strong>14</strong> Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi (Well of the Living One Who Sees Me); behold, it is between Kadesh (Holy) and Bered (Hail).
  </p>
  <p><strong>15</strong> And Hagar bore a son to Abram, and Abram called the name of his son whom Hagar bore, Ishmael (God Hears).</p>
  <p><strong>16</strong> And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael (God Hears) to Abram.</p>
