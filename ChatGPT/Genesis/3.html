<h1>Genesis 3</h1>

<p><sup>1</sup>Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field that the LORD God (YHWH Elohim – He is God, Mighty One) had made. And he said to the woman (Ishah - woman), “Did God (Elohim – God, Mighty One) really say, ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?”</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat from the fruit of the trees of the garden,</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>but of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, God said, ‘You shall not eat from it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.’”</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>And the serpent said to the woman, “You shall not surely die,</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>for God knows that in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. And she also gave some to her husband (Ish – man), who was with her, and he ate.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the face of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>Then the LORD God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>And he said, “I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself.”</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>And He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?”</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>And the man said, “The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me from the tree, and I ate.”</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this that you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>So the LORD God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above every beast of the field. On your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He shall crush your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>To the woman He said, “I will surely multiply your pain in childbirth; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.”</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>And to Adam (Adam – Human) He said, “Because you listened to the voice of your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it,’ cursed is the ground (adamah – soil) because of you. In pain you shall eat from it all the days of your life.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>Thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, and you shall eat the plants of the field.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for dust you are, and to dust you shall return.”</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>And the man called his wife's name Eve (Chavah – Life), because she was the mother of all living.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>And the LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the human has become like one of Us in knowing good and evil. And now, lest he reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever—”</p>

<p><sup>23</sup>So the LORD God sent him out from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup>And He drove out the human, and He placed cherubim at the east of the Garden of Eden and a flaming sword that turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.</p>
