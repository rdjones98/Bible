    <h1>Genesis 3</h1>
    <p><strong>1</strong> And the serpent was cunning more than all the beasts of the field which the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) God(Elohim - Mighty Ones) had made. And he said to the woman, "Indeed, has God (Elohim) said, 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden'?"</p>
    <p><strong>2</strong> And the woman said to the serpent, "From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat. <strong>3</strong> But from the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God (Elohim) has said, 'You shall not eat from it, and you shall not touch it, lest you die.'"</p>
    <p><strong>4</strong> And the serpent said to the woman, "Dying, you shall not die. <strong>5</strong> For God (Elohim) knows that in the day you eat from it, then your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God (Elohim), knowing good and evil."</p>
    <p><strong>6</strong> And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was desirable to the eyes, and the tree was desirable to make one wise. And she took from its fruit and ate. And she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.</p>
    <p><strong>7</strong> And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed together fig leaves and made for themselves coverings.</p>
    <p><strong>8</strong> And they heard the sound of Lord God walking in the garden in the wind of the day. And the man (Adam - Human) and his wife hid themselves from the face of Lord God in the midst of the trees of the garden.</p>
    <p><strong>9</strong> And Lord God called to the man and said to him, "Where are you?"</p>
    <p><strong>10</strong> And he said, "I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I am naked, and I hid myself."</p>
    <p><strong>11</strong> And He said, "Who told you that you are naked? Have you eaten from the tree which I commanded you not to eat from?"</p>
    <p><strong>12</strong> And the man said, "The woman (Eve - Life) whom You gave to be with me, she gave me from the tree, and I ate."</p>
    <p><strong>13</strong> And Lord God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?"</p>
    <p><strong>14</strong> And the woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."</p>
    <p><strong>15</strong> And Lord God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all the beasts, and above all the animals of the field. On your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life. <strong>16</strong> And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. He shall bruise you on the head, and you shall bruise him on the heel."</p>
    <p><strong>17</strong> To the woman He said, "I will greatly multiply your pain and your conception; in pain you shall bear children. And to your husband shall be your desire, and he shall rule over you."</p>
    <p><strong>18</strong> And to the man He said, "Because you listened to the voice of your wife and ate from the tree which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat from it,' cursed is the ground because of you. In toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life. <strong>19</strong> And thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, and you shall eat the plants of the field. <strong>20</strong> By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, until you return to the ground, for from it you were taken. For dust you are, and to dust you shall return."</p>
    <p><strong>21</strong> And the man called the name of his wife Eve (Life), because she was the mother of all living.</p>
    <p><strong>22</strong> And Lord God made for Adam (Human) and for his wife garments of skin and clothed them.</p>
    <p><strong>23</strong> And Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. And now, lest he stretch out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat and live foreverâ€”"</p>
    <p><strong>24</strong> And Lord God sent him from the garden of Eden (Delight) to work the ground from which he was taken.</p>
    <p><strong>25</strong> And He drove out the man, and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden (Delight) the cherubim and the flaming sword turning every way to guard the way to the tree of life.</p>
