 and the baker
 of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1175" class="text Gen-40-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Pharaoh was angry
 with his two officials,
 the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,</span> <span id="en-NIV-1176" class="text Gen-40-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard,
 in the same prison where Joseph was confined.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1177" class="text Gen-40-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>The captain of the guard
 assigned them to Joseph,
 and he attended them.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-40-4">After they had been in custody
 for some time,</span> <span id="en-NIV-1178" class="text Gen-40-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>each of the two men—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison—had a dream
 the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1179" class="text Gen-40-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1180" class="text Gen-40-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were in custody
 with him in his master’s house, “Why do you look so sad today?”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1181" class="text Gen-40-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>“We both had dreams,” they answered, “but there is no one to interpret them.”
</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-40-8">Then Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God?
 Tell me your dreams.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1182" class="text Gen-40-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>So the chief cupbearer
 told Joseph his dream. He said to him, “In my dream I saw a vine in front of me,</span> <span id="en-NIV-1183" class="text Gen-40-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed,
 and its clusters ripened into grapes.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1184" class="text Gen-40-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup and put the cup in his hand.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1185" class="text Gen-40-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>“This is what it means,
” Joseph said to him. “The three branches are three days.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1186" class="text Gen-40-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Within three days
 Pharaoh will lift up your head
 and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1187" class="text Gen-40-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>But when all goes well with you, remember me
 and show me kindness;
 mention me to Pharaoh
 and get me out of this prison.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1188" class="text Gen-40-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews,
 and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1189" class="text Gen-40-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>When the chief baker
 saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation,
 he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream: On my head were three baskets
 of bread.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1189a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1189a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1189a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup></span> <span id="en-NIV-1190" class="text Gen-40-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1191" class="text Gen-40-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>“This is what it means,” Joseph said. “The three baskets are three days.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1192" class="text Gen-40-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Within three days
 Pharaoh will lift off your head
 and impale your body on a pole.
 And the birds will eat away your flesh.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1193" class="text Gen-40-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Now the third day
 was Pharaoh’s birthday,
 and he gave a feast for all his officials.
 He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker
 in the presence of his officials:</span> <span id="en-NIV-1194" class="text Gen-40-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>He restored the chief cupbearer
 to his position,
 so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand
—</span> <span id="en-NIV-1195" class="text Gen-40-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>but he impaled the chief baker,
 just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1196" class="text Gen-40-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.
