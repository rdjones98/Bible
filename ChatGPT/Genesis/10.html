<h1>Genesis 10</h1>

<p><sup>1</sup>This is the account of the families of the sons of Noah (Noach – Rest): Shem (Shem – Name), Ham (Ham – Hot), and Japheth (Yafeth – Fair); and the sons who were born to them after the flood.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>The sons of Japheth: Gomer (Gomer – Complete), Magog (Magog – Land of Gog), Madai (Madai – Middle), Javan (Yavan – Greece), Tubal (Tubal – To Be Changed), Meshech (Meshech – Drawing Out), and Tiras (Tiras – Desiring).</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>The sons of Javan: Elishah (Elishah – God Is My Salvation), Tarshish (Tarshish – A Stone), Kittim (Kittim – Cut-Off), and Dodanim (Dodanim – Beloved).</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>From these the coastland peoples spread in their lands, each with its own language, by their clans and in their nations.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>The sons of Ham: Cush (Cush – Ethiopia), Mizraim (Mizraim – Egypt), Put (Put – Libyan), and Canaan (Kena'an – Lowland).</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>The sons of Cush: Seba (Seba – Vail), Havilah (Havilah – Circle), Sabtah (Sabtah – Subtle), Raamah (Raamah – Thunder), and Sabtechah (Sabtechah – Subtle). The sons of Raamah: Sheba (Sheba – Oath) and Dedan (Dedan – Lowland).</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>Cush was the father of Nimrod (Nimrod – Rebellious), who became a mighty warrior on the earth.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>He was a mighty hunter before the LORD (YHWH - He is); that is why it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD (YHWH - He is).”</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon (Bavel – Confusion), Erech (Urekh – City of the King), Akkad (Akkad – Mighty), and Calneh (Kalneh – Fortress), in Shinar (Shinar – Two Rivers).</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>From that land he went to Assyria (Ashur – Ashur), where he built Nineveh (Ninveh – Fish), Rehoboth Ir (Reḥovot ʿIr – Streets of the City), Calah (Kalah – Complete),</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>and Resen (Resen – Enclosure), which is between Nineveh and Calah. That is the great city.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>Mizraim was the father of the Ludim (Ludim – Lydians), Anamim (Anamim – Ancient), Lehabim (Lehabim – Flame), Naphtuhim (Naphtuhim – Broad),</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>Pathrusim (Pathrusim – Southlanders), Casluhim (Kasluhim – Migrants) (from whom the Philistines (Pelishtim – Migrants) came) and Caphtorim (Kafṭorim – A Place of God).</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>Canaan was the father of Sidon (Tsidon – Fisher) his firstborn, and of the Hittites (Hittim – Children of Heth),</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>the Hivites (Chivim – Villagers), the Arkites (Arkim – Arkan), the Sinites (Sinitim – The Sinites),</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>the Arvadites (Arvadim – Arvad), the Zemarites (Zemarim – The Zemarites), and the Hamathites (Chamatim – Hamathites). Later the Canaanite clans scattered</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar (Gerar – Rolling) as far as Gaza (Azah – Stronghold), and then toward Sodom (Sedom – Burning), Gomorrah (ʿAmorah – Submersion), Admah (Admah – Red), and Zeboyim (Tzevo’im – Station), as far as Lasha (Lasha – Captivity).</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>These are the sons of Ham, by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber (Eber – Beyond).</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>The sons of Shem: Elam (Elam – Eternity), Ashur (Ashur – Ashur), Arphaxad (Arpakshad – Healer), Lud (Lud – Strife), and Aram (Aram – High).</p>

<p><sup>23</sup>The sons of Aram: Uz (ʿUz – Strength), Hul (Ḥul – Spiral), Gether (Geter – Greatness), and Meshech (Meshech – Drawing Out).</p>

<p><sup>24</sup>Arphaxad was the father of Shelah (Shelah – Petition), and Shelah the father of Eber.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup>Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg (Peleg – Division), because in his time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan (Yoqtan – Small).</p>

<p><sup>26</sup>Joktan was the father of Almodad (Almodad – The Eternal), Sheleph (Shelaph – The Sent), Hazarmaveth (Ḥazarmavet – Court of Death), Jerah (Yerah – Moon),</p>

<p><sup>27</sup>Hadoram (Hadoram – Glorious), Uzal (Uzal – Strong), Diklah (Diqlah – Palm Tree),</p>

<p><sup>28</sup>Obal (Oval – Circle), Abimael (Avimael – Father of the King), Sheba (Sheba – Oath),</p>

<p><sup>29</sup>Ophir (Ofir – Gold), Havilah (Havilah – Circle), and Jobab (Yovav – Persecutor).</p>

<p><sup>30</sup>All these were the sons of Joktan.</p>

<p><sup>31</sup>Their territory extended from Mesha toward Sephar (Sephar – Mount), the eastern hill country.</p>

<p><sup>32</sup>These are the sons of Shem, by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.</p>

<p><sup>33</sup>These are the clans of the sons of Noah, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.</p>
