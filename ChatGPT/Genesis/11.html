<h1>Genesis 11</h1>

<p><sup>1</sup>Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>As people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar (Shinar – Two Rivers) and settled there.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>They said to each other, “Come, let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>But the LORD (YHWH - He is) came down to see the city and the tower the people were building.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>The LORD said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>That is why it was called Babel (Bavel – Confusion) — because there the LORD confused the language of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>This is the account of Shem (Shem – Name): Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of Arphaxad (Arpakshad – Healer).</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>And after he became the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah (Shelah – Petition).</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>And after he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>When Shelah had lived 30 years, he became the father of Eber (Eber – Beyond).</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>And after he became the father of Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>When Eber had lived 34 years, he became the father of Peleg (Peleg – Division).</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>And after he became the father of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>When Peleg had lived 30 years, he became the father of Reu (Re'u – Shepherd).</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>And after he became the father of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>When Reu had lived 32 years, he became the father of Serug (Serug – Branch).</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>And after he became the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>When Serug had lived 30 years, he became the father of Nahor (Nachor – Snoring).</p>

<p><sup>23</sup>And after he became the father of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup>When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father of Terah (Terah – Wanderer).</p>

<p><sup>25</sup>And after he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup>When Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father of Abram (Avram – Exalted Father), Nahor, and Haran (Haran – Mountain).</p>

<p><sup>27</sup>This is the account of Terah: Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot (Lot – Veil).</p>

<p><sup>28</sup>While his father Terah was still alive, Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans (Kasdim – Chaldeans), in the land of his birth.</p>

<p><sup>29</sup>And Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai (Sarai – My Princess), and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milkah (Milkah – Queen); she was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milkah and Iscah (Yiskah – Gaze).</p>

<p><sup>30</sup>Now Sara was childless because she was not able to have children.</p>

<p><sup>31</sup>Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sara, the wife of his son Abram, and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans (Kasdim – Chaldeans) to go to Canaan (Kena'an – Lowland). But when they came to Haran, they settled there.</p>

<p><sup>32</sup>Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Haran.</p>
