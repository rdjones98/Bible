    <h1>Genesis 1 - Literal Translation</h1>
    <p><strong>1:</strong> In the beginning, <strong><a href="../Commentary/Names of God.html">God</a> (<a href="../Commentary/Elohim.html">Elohim - Mighty Ones</a>)</strong> created the heavens and the earth.</p>
    <p><strong>2:</strong> And the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the face of the deep, and the <strong><a href="../Commentary/Names of Holy Spirit.html">Spirit of God</a> </strong> (Ruach Elohim - Breath of Mighty Ones) was hovering over the face of the waters.</p>
    <p><strong>3:</strong> And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</p>
    <p><strong>4:</strong> And God saw the light, that it was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.</p>
    <p><strong>5:</strong> And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening, and there was morning, one day.</p>
    <p><strong>6:</strong> And God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."</p>
    <p><strong>7:</strong> And God made the expanse, and He separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse, and it was so.</p>
    <p><strong>8:</strong> And God called the expanse Heavens. And there was evening, and there was morning, a second day.</p>
    <p><strong>9:</strong> And God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered to one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so.</p>
    <p><strong>10:</strong> And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering of the waters He called Seas. And God saw that it was good.</p>
    <p><strong>11:</strong> And God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, in which is their seed, upon the earth." And it was so.</p>
    <p><strong>12:</strong> And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, in which is their seed, after their kind. And God saw that it was good.</p>
    <p><strong>13:</strong> And there was evening, and there was morning, a third day.</p>
    <p><strong>14:</strong> And God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for appointed times and for days and years."</p>
    <p><strong>15:</strong> "And let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth." And it was so.</p>
    <p><strong>16:</strong> And God made the two great lights: the greater light for ruling the day, and the lesser light for ruling the night, and the stars.</p>
    <p><strong>17:</strong> And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth,</p>
    <p><strong>18:</strong> and to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.</p>
    <p><strong>19:</strong> And there was evening, and there was morning, a fourth day.</p>
    <p><strong>20:</strong> And God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the expanse of the heavens."</p>
    <p><strong>21:</strong> And God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</p>
    <p><strong>22:</strong> And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth."</p>
    <p><strong>23:</strong> And there was evening, and there was morning, a fifth day.</p>
    <p><strong>24:</strong> And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kind—livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kind." And it was so.</p>
    <p><strong>25:</strong> And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kind and the livestock according to their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</p>
    <p><strong>26:</strong> And God said, "Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."</p>
    <p><strong>27:</strong> And God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.</p>
    <p><strong>28:</strong> And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it. And have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth."</p>
    <p><strong>29:</strong> And God said, "Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed—to you it shall be for food."</p>
    <p><strong>30:</strong> "And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which is a living soul, I have given every green plant for food." And it was so.</p>
    <p><strong>31:</strong> And God saw everything that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day.</p>
