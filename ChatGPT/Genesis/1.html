    <h1>Genesis 1</h1>
    <p><strong>1.</strong> In the beginning, God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) created the heavens and the earth.</p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> And the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God (Ruach Elohim) was hovering over the face of the waters.</p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</p>
    <p><strong>4.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) saw the light, that it was good, and God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) separated between the light and between the darkness.</p>
    <p><strong>5.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening, and there was morning, one day.</p>
    <p><strong>6.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it be separating between waters and waters."</p>
    <p><strong>7.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) made the expanse and separated between the waters which were under the expanse and between the waters which were above the expanse, and it was so.</p>
    <p><strong>8.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) called the expanse Heavens. And there was evening, and there was morning, a second day.</p>
    <p><strong>9.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered to one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so.</p>
    <p><strong>10.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) called the dry land Earth, and the gathering of the waters He called Seas. And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) saw that it was good.</p>
    <p><strong>11.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) said, "Let the earth bring forth vegetation: herbage yielding seed, fruit tree making fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in it, upon the earth." And it was so.</p>
    <p><strong>12.</strong> And the earth brought forth vegetation: herbage yielding seed according to its kind, and tree making fruit, whose seed is in it, according to its kind. And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) saw that it was good.</p>
    <p><strong>13.</strong> And there was evening, and there was morning, a third day.</p>
    <p><strong>14.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate between the day and between the night, and they shall be for signs, and for appointed times, and for days and years.</p>
    <p><strong>15.</strong> And they shall be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth." And it was so.</p>
    <p><strong>16.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) made the two great lights: the greater light for ruling the day, and the lesser light for ruling the night, and the stars.</p>
    <p><strong>17.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth,</p>
    <p><strong>18.</strong> and to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate between the light and between the darkness. And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) saw that it was good.</p>
    <p><strong>19.</strong> And there was evening, and there was morning, a fourth day.</p>
    <p><strong>20.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) said, "Let the waters swarm with a swarm of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the expanse of the heavens."</p>
    <p><strong>21.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) saw that it was good.</p>
    <p><strong>22.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth."</p>
    <p><strong>23.</strong> And there was evening, and there was morning, a fifth day.</p>
    <p><strong>24.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kind: livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kind." And it was so.</p>
    <p><strong>25.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) made the beasts of the earth according to their kind, and the livestock according to their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) saw that it was good.</p>
    <p><strong>26.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."</p>
    <p><strong>27.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) created man in His image; in the image of God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) He created him; male and female He created them.</p>
    <p><strong>28.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) blessed them. And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth."</p>
    <p><strong>31.</strong> And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day.</p>
