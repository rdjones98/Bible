 met him.</span> <span id="en-NIV-931" class="text Gen-32-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God!”
 So he named that place Mahanaim.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-931b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-931b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-931b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-932" class="text Gen-32-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Jacob sent messengers
 ahead of him to his brother Esau
 in the land of Seir,
 the country of Edom.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-933" class="text Gen-32-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>He instructed them: “This is what you are to say to my lord
 Esau: ‘Your servant
 Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban
 and have remained there till now.</span> <span id="en-NIV-934" class="text Gen-32-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants.
 Now I am sending this message to my lord,
 that I may find favor in your eyes.
’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-935" class="text Gen-32-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-936" class="text Gen-32-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>In great fear
 and distress
 Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-936c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-936c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-936c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>
 and the flocks and herds and camels as well.</span> <span id="en-NIV-937" class="text Gen-32-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one group,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-937d' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-937d&quot; title=&quot;See footnote d&quot;&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-937d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup> the group<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-937e' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-937e&quot; title=&quot;See footnote e&quot;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-937e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> that is left may escape.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-938" class="text Gen-32-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham,
 God of my father Isaac,
 <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, you who said to me, ‘Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,’
</span> <span id="en-NIV-939" class="text Gen-32-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness
 you have shown your servant. I had only my staff
 when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-940" class="text Gen-32-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid
 he will come and attack me,
 and also the mothers with their children.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-941" class="text Gen-32-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>But you have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand
 of the sea, which cannot be counted.
’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-942" class="text Gen-32-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift
 for his brother Esau:</span> <span id="en-NIV-943" class="text Gen-32-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-944" class="text Gen-32-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-945" class="text Gen-32-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-946" class="text Gen-32-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>He instructed the one in the lead: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘Who do you belong to, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?’</span> <span id="en-NIV-947" class="text Gen-32-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant
 Jacob. They are a gift
 sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-948" class="text Gen-32-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: “You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.</span> <span id="en-NIV-949" class="text Gen-32-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>And be sure to say, ‘Your servant
 Jacob is coming behind us.’” For he thought, “I will pacify him with these gifts
 I am sending on ahead;
 later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-950" class="text Gen-32-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>So Jacob’s gifts
 went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-951" class="text Gen-32-22">Jacob Wrestles With God</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-32-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons
 and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-952" class="text Gen-32-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-953" class="text Gen-32-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>So Jacob was left alone,
 and a man
 wrestled with him till daybreak.</span> <span id="en-NIV-954" class="text Gen-32-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip
 so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.</span> <span id="en-NIV-955" class="text Gen-32-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-32-26">But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-956" class="text Gen-32-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>The man asked him, “What is your name?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-32-27">“Jacob,”
 he answered.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-957" class="text Gen-32-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Then the man said, “Your name
 will no longer be Jacob, but Israel,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-957f' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-957f&quot; title=&quot;See footnote f&quot;&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-957f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup>
 because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-958" class="text Gen-32-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.”
</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-32-29">But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?”
 Then he blessed
 him there.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-959" class="text Gen-32-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>So Jacob called the place Peniel,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-959g' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-959g&quot; title=&quot;See footnote g&quot;&gt;g&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-959g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> saying, “It is because I saw God face to face,
 and yet my life was spared.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-960" class="text Gen-32-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-960h' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-960h&quot; title=&quot;See footnote h&quot;&gt;h&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-960h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup>
 and he was limping because of his hip.</span> <span id="en-NIV-961" class="text Gen-32-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip,
 because the socket of Jacob’s hip was touched near the tendon.</span></p> </div><div class='il-text'></div><div class="footnotes">
