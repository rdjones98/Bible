<h1>Genesis 2</h1>

<p><sup>1</sup>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their host.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>And on the seventh day God (Elohim – God, Mighty One) finished His work that He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work that He had done.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all His work that He had created to do.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God (YHWH Elohim – He is God, Mighty One) made the earth and the heavens.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>No bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up—for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no human to work the ground—</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground—</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>then the LORD God formed the human (ha-adam – the man) from the dust of the ground (adamah – soil) and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the human became a living being.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden (Eden – Delight), in the east, and there He put the human whom He had formed.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>And out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>A river went out from Eden to water the garden, and from there it separated and became four headwaters.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>The name of the first is Pishon (Pishon – Spreading), which flows around the whole land of Havilah (Havilah – Circular or Sandy), where there is gold.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>The name of the second river is Gihon (Gichon – Gushing), which flows around the whole land of Cush (Kush – Black).</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>The name of the third river is Tigris (Chiddekel – Rapid), which flows east of Assyria (Ashur – Step or Happy). And the fourth river is the Euphrates (Perat – Fruitfulness).</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>the LORD God took the human and placed him in the Garden of Eden to work it and to keep it.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>And the LORD God commanded the human, saying, “You may surely eat from every tree of the garden,</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die.”</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>Then the LORD God said, “It is not good that the human should be alone; I will make a helper fit for him.”</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground every beast of the field and every bird of the sky and brought them to the human to see what he would call them. And whatever the human called each living creature, that was its name.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>The human gave names to all livestock, to the birds of the sky, and to every beast of the field. But for the human, there was not found a helper fit for him.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the human, and he slept. And He took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the human He made into a woman and brought her to the human.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup>And the human said, “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman (Ishah – from man), because she was taken out of Man (Ish).”</p>

<p><sup>24</sup>Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup>And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.</p>
