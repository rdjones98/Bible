    <h1>Genesis 2</h1>
    <p>1 And the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their host.</p>
    <p>2 And on the seventh day, <strong>God (Elohim - Mighty Ones)</strong> completed His work that He had done, and He ceased on the seventh day from all His work that He had done.</p>
    <p>3 And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, for in it He ceased from all His work, which God created to do.</p>
    <p>4 These are the generations of the heavens and the earth in their being created, in the day the <strong><a href="../Commentary/Names of God.html">Lord</a> (YHWH - He Who Exists) <a href="../Commentary/Elohim.html">God </a>(Elohim - Mighty Ones)</strong> made earth and heavens.</p>
    <p>5 And every shrub of the field was not yet in the earth, and every herb of the field had not yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not caused rain upon the earth, and there was no man to work the ground.</p>
    <p>6 And a mist went up from the earth and watered all the face of the ground.</p>
    <p>7 And the Lord God formed the man (Adam, "human") from the dust of the ground (Adamah, "ground"), and He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man (Adam, "human") became a living soul.</p>
    <p>8 And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden ("delight"), eastward, and He placed there the man (Adam, "human") whom He had formed.</p>

    <p>9 And the Lord God caused to sprout from the ground every tree desirable for sight and good for food, and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
    <p>10 And a river went out from Eden ("delight") to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four heads.</p>
    <p>11 The name of the first is Pishon ("increase"), it is that which encircles all the land of Havilah ("writhing"), where there is gold.</p>
    <p>12 And the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</p>
    <p>13 And the name of the second river is Gihon ("bursting forth"), it is that which encircles all the land of Cush ("black").</p>
    <p>14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel ("rapid"), it is that which goes east of Asshur ("Assyria"); and the fourth river is Perat ("fruitfulness").</p>
    <p>15 And the Lord God took the man (Adam, "human") and placed him in the garden of Eden ("delight") to work it and to keep it.</p>
    <p>16 And the Lord God commanded the man (Adam, "human"), saying, "From every tree of the garden you may surely eat,</p>
    <p>17 but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it, you shall surely die."</p>
    <p>18 And the Lord God said, "It is not good for the man (Adam, "human") to be alone; I will make him a helper corresponding to him."</p>
    <p>19 And the Lord God formed from the ground every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens, and He brought them to the man (Adam, "human") to see what he would call them; and whatever the man (Adam, "human") called a living soul, that was its name.</p>
    <p>20 And the man (Adam, "human") gave names to all the livestock, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field, but for Adam ("human") there was not found a helper corresponding to him.</p>
    <p>21 And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man (Adam, "human"), and he slept, and He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place.</p>
    <p>22 And the Lord God built the rib that He took from the man (Adam, "human") into a woman (Ishah, "woman"), and He brought her to the man (Adam, "human").</p>
    <p>23 And the man (Adam, "human") said, "This now is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; this shall be called Woman (Ishah, "woman"), for from man (Ish, "man") she was taken."</p>
    <p>24 Therefore, a man (Ish, "man") shall leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife, and they shall be one flesh.</p>
    <p>25 And they were both naked, the man (Adam, "human") and his wife, and they were not ashamed.</p>
