<h1>Genesis 5</h1>

<p><sup>1</sup>This is the book of the generations of Adam (Adam – Human). When God (Elohim – Mighty Ones) created man, He made him in the likeness of God.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Male and female He created them, and He blessed them and named them Man when they were created.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth (Shet – Appointed).</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>The days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years; and he had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>Thus all the days that Adam lived were 930 years, and he died.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>When Seth had lived 105 years, he fathered Enosh (Enosh – Mortal or Frail One).</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>The days of Seth after he fathered Enosh were 807 years; and he had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>Thus all the days of Seth were 912 years, and he died.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>When Enosh had lived 90 years, he fathered Kenan (Kenan – Sorrowful).</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>The days of Enosh after he fathered Kenan were 815 years; and he had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>Thus all the days of Enosh were 905 years, and he died.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>When Kenan had lived 70 years, he fathered Mahalalel (Mahalalel – Praise of God).</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>The days of Kenan after he fathered Mahalalel were 840 years; and he had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>Thus all the days of Kenan were 910 years, and he died.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he fathered Jared (Yared – Descent).</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>The days of Mahalalel after he fathered Jared were 830 years; and he had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>Thus all the days of Mahalalel were 895 years, and he died.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>When Jared had lived 162 years, he fathered Enoch (Chanokh – Dedicated).</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>The days of Jared after he fathered Enoch were 800 years; and he had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>Thus all the days of Jared were 962 years, and he died.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>When Enoch had lived 65 years, he fathered Methuselah (Metushelach – Man of the Dart).</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>Enoch walked with God after he fathered Methuselah 300 years and had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup>Thus all the days of Enoch were 365 years.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup>Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup>When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he fathered Lamech (Lemekh – Powerful or Wild).</p>

<p><sup>26</sup>The days of Methuselah after he fathered Lamech were 782 years; and he had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup>Thus all the days of Methuselah were 969 years, and he died.</p>

<p><sup>28</sup>When Lamech had lived 182 years, he fathered a son</p>

<p><sup>29</sup>and called his name Noah (Noach – Rest), saying, “Out of the ground that YHWH has cursed, this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the painful toil of our hands.”</p>

<p><sup>30</sup>The days of Lamech after he fathered Noah were 595 years; and he had other sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>31</sup>Thus all the days of Lamech were 777 years, and he died.</p>

<p><sup>32</sup>After Noah was 500 years old, Noah fathered Shem (Shem – Name), Ham (Ham – Hot), and Japheth (Yafeth – Fair).</p>
