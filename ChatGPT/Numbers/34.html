    <h1>Numbers 34</h1>
    <p>1 And the LORD (YHWH – He is) spoke to Moses (Drawn Out), saying,</p>
    <p>2 "Command the sons of Israel (God Strives) and say to them, 'When you come into the land of Canaan (Lowland), this is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance, the land of Canaan (Lowland) to its borders.</p>
    <p>3 And your southern side shall be from the wilderness of Zin (Flat) alongside Edom (Red), and your southern border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward.</p>
    <p>4 And the border shall turn around from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim (Scorpions) and pass to Zin (Flat), and its extremity shall be from the south to Kadesh-Barnea (Holy-Purifier), and it shall go out to Hazar-Addar (Village of Majesty) and pass over to Azmon (Strong).</p>
    <p>5 And the border shall turn around from Azmon (Strong) to the brook of Egypt (Double Straits), and its extremity shall be to the sea.</p>
    <p>6 And the western border shall be to you the Great Sea and border; this shall be your western border.</p>
    <p>7 And this shall be your northern border: from the Great Sea you shall mark out to Mount Hor (Mountain).</p>
    <p>8 From Mount Hor (Mountain) you shall mark out to the entrance of Hamath (Fortress), and the extremity of the border shall be to Zedad (Side).</p>
    <p>9 And the border shall go out to Ziphron (Fragrance), and its extremity shall be Hazar-Enan (Village of Springs); this shall be your northern border.</p>
    <p>10 And you shall mark out for yourselves as the eastern border from Hazar-Enan (Village of Springs) to Shepham (Bald).</p>
    <p>11 And the border shall go down from Shepham (Bald) to Riblah (Fertility) on the east of Ain (Spring), and the border shall go down and reach to the shoulder of the Sea of Chinnereth (Harp) eastward.</p>
    <p>12 And the border shall go down to the Jordan (Descender), and its extremity shall be the Salt Sea; this shall be your land according to its borders all around.'</p>
    <p>13 And Moses commanded the sons of Israel (God Strives), saying, "This is the land which you shall inherit by lot, which the LORD (YHWH – He is) commanded to give to the nine tribes and the half-tribe.</p>
    <p>14 For the tribe of the sons of Reuben (Behold a Son) according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the sons of Gad (Troop) according to the house of their fathers, have received; and the half-tribe of Manasseh (Causing to Forget) have received their inheritance.</p>
    <p>15 The two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance across the Jordan (Descender) opposite Jericho (Fragrant), eastward toward the sunrise."</p>
    <p>16 And the LORD (YHWH – He is) spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
    <p>17 "These are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you as an inheritance: Eleazar (God Has Helped) the priest, and Joshua (YHWH Saves) son of Nun (Perpetuity).</p>
    <p>18 And one leader, one leader from a tribe you shall take to divide the land as an inheritance.</p>
    <p>19 And these are the names of the men: from the tribe of Judah (Praise), Caleb (Dog) son of Jephunneh (He Will Be Prepared).</p>
    <p>20 And from the tribe of the sons of Simeon (Heard), Shemuel (God Has Heard) son of Ammihud (My Kinsman is Majestic).</p>
    <p>21 From the tribe of Benjamin (Son of the Right Hand), Elidad (God Has Loved) son of Chislon (Hope).</p>
    <p>22 And from the tribe of the sons of Dan (Judge), a leader, Bukki (Wasting) son of Jogli (Exiled).</p>
    <p>23 From the sons of Joseph (He Adds): from the tribe of the sons of Manasseh (Causing to Forget), a leader, Hanniel (God is Gracious) son of Ephod (Garment).</p>
    <p>24 And from the tribe of the sons of Ephraim (Twice Fruitful), a leader, Kemuel (God Stands) son of Shiphtan (Judge).</p>
    <p>25 And from the tribe of the sons of Zebulun (Exalted), a leader, Elizaphan (My God Has Treasured) son of Parnach (Delicate).</p>
    <p>26 And from the tribe of the sons of Issachar (There is Reward), a leader, Paltiel (God is My Deliverance) son of Azzan (Strong).</p>
    <p>27 And from the tribe of the sons of Asher (Happy), a leader, Ahihud (My Brother is Majestic) son of Shelomi (My Peace).</p>
    <p>28 And from the tribe of the sons of Naphtali (My Wrestling), a leader, Pedahel (God Has Redeemed) son of Ammihud (My Kinsman is Majestic).</p>
    <p>29 These are the ones whom the LORD (YHWH – He is) commanded to distribute the inheritance to the sons of Israel (God Strives) in the land of Canaan (Lowland).</p>
