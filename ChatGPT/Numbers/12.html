    <h1>Numbers 12</h1>
    
    <p>1. And Miriam (Bitter) and Aaron (Light Bringer) spoke against Moses (Drawn Out) because of the Cushite woman whom he had taken, for he had taken a Cushite woman.</p>
    
    <p>2. And they said, “Has the LORD (YHWH – He is) indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not also spoken through us?” And the LORD (YHWH – He is) heard.</p>
    
    <p>3. And the man Moses was very humble, more than all the men who were upon the face of the earth.</p>
    
    <p>4. And the LORD (YHWH – He is) said suddenly to Moses and to Aaron and to Miriam, “Go out, you three, to the Tent of Meeting.” And the three went out.</p>
    
    <p>5. And the LORD (YHWH – He is) came down in the pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the Tent, and He called Aaron and Miriam, and they both went forward.</p>
    
    <p>6. And He said, “Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD (YHWH – He is), make Myself known to him in a vision; in a dream I speak to him.”</p>
    
    <p>7. “Not so My servant Moses; he is faithful in all My house.”</p>
    
    <p>8. “Mouth to mouth I speak with him, and plainly, and not in riddles, and he beholds the form of the LORD (YHWH – He is). And why were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?”</p>
    
    <p>9. And the anger of the LORD (YHWH – He is) burned against them, and He departed.</p>
    
    <p>10. And the cloud turned away from above the Tent, and behold, Miriam was leprous, white as snow. And Aaron turned to Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.</p>
    
    <p>11. And Aaron said to Moses, “Oh my lord, do not lay this sin upon us, in which we have acted foolishly and in which we have sinned.”</p>
    
    <p>12. “Let her not be as one dead, who comes out of his mother’s womb with half his flesh consumed.”</p>
    
    <p>13. And Moses cried to the LORD (YHWH – He is), saying, “O God, please heal her, please!”</p>
    
    <p>14. And the LORD (YHWH – He is) said to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut outside the camp seven days, and afterward she shall be brought in again.”</p>
    
    <p>15. And Miriam was shut outside the camp seven days, and the people did not journey until Miriam was brought in again.</p>
    
    <p>16. And afterward the people set out from Hazeroth (Villages) and encamped in the Wilderness of Paran (Ornamental).</p>
