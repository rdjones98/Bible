    <h1>Numbers 11</h1>
    
    <p>1. And it was, the people were as ones complaining evil in the ears of the LORD (YHWH – He is), and the LORD (YHWH – He is) heard, and His anger was kindled, and the fire of the LORD (YHWH – He is) burned among them, and it consumed at the edge of the camp.</p>
    
    <p>2. And the people cried to Moses (Drawn Out), and Moses prayed to the LORD (YHWH – He is), and the fire sank down.</p>
    
    <p>3. And he called the name of that place Taberah (Burning), for the fire of the LORD (YHWH – He is) burned among them.</p>
    
    <p>4. And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted a lust, and also the sons of Israel (He Struggles With God) wept again, and they said, “Who will feed us meat?”</p>
    
    <p>5. “We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt freely, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.”</p>
    
    <p>6. “And now, our soul is dry, there is nothing; except the manna before our eyes.”</p>
    
    <p>7. And the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium.</p>
    
    <p>8. The people went about and gathered and ground it in a mill, or beat it in a mortar, and boiled it in a pot and made it into cakes. And its taste was like the taste of fresh oil.</p>
    
    <p>9. And when the dew came down upon the camp at night, the manna came down upon it.</p>
    
    <p>10. And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, each man at the entrance of his tent, and the anger of the LORD (YHWH – He is) burned greatly, and in the eyes of Moses it was evil.</p>
    
    <p>11. And Moses said to the LORD (YHWH – He is), “Why have You done evil to Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your eyes, that You put the burden of all this people upon me?”</p>
    
    <p>12. “Have I conceived all this people? Have I given birth to them, that You should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom as a nursing father carries the suckling child,’ to the land which You swore to their fathers?”</p>
    
    <p>13. “Where is meat for me to give to all this people? For they weep upon me, saying, ‘Give us meat, and we will eat!’”</p>
    
    <p>14. “I am not able to carry all this people alone, for it is too heavy for me.”</p>
    
    <p>15. “And if thus You deal with me, please kill me, if I have found favor in Your eyes, and let me not see my misery.”</p>
    
    <p>16. And the LORD (YHWH – He is) said to Moses, “Gather to Me seventy men from the elders of Israel (He Struggles With God), whom you know that they are elders of the people and officers over them, and bring them to the Tent of Meeting, and they shall stand there with you.”</p>
    
    <p>17. “And I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take from the spirit that is upon you and place it upon them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so you do not bear it alone.”</p>
    
    <p>18. And you shall say to the people, “Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat, for you have wept in the ears of the LORD (YHWH – He is), saying, ‘Who will feed us meat? For it was good for us in Egypt.’ And the LORD (YHWH – He is) will give you meat, and you shall eat.”</p>
    
    <p>19. “Not one day shall you eat, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days.”</p>
    
    <p>20. “But for a month of days, until it comes out from your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected the LORD (YHWH – He is), who is in your midst, and have wept before Him, saying, ‘Why did we come out from Egypt?’”</p>

    <p>21. And Moses said, “The people among whom I am are six hundred thousand on foot, and You have said, ‘I will give them meat, and they shall eat for a month of days!’”</p>
    
    <p>22. “Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, that it be enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered for them, that it be enough for them?”</p>
    
    <p>23. And the LORD (YHWH – He is) said to Moses, “Is the hand of the LORD (YHWH – He is) too short? Now you shall see whether My word comes to pass for you or not.”</p>
    
    <p>24. And Moses went out and spoke the words of the LORD (YHWH – He is) to the people, and he gathered seventy men from the elders of the people and stood them around the Tent.</p>
    
    <p>25. And the LORD (YHWH – He is) came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took from the spirit that was upon him and placed it upon the seventy elders. And it was, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did not continue.</p>
    
    <p>26. And two men remained in the camp, the name of one was Eldad (God Has Loved), and the name of the second was Medad (Loving), and the spirit rested upon them. And they were among the written ones, but they did not go out to the Tent, and they prophesied in the camp.</p>
    
    <p>27. And a young man ran and told Moses and said, “Eldad (God Has Loved) and Medad (Loving) are prophesying in the camp.”</p>
    
    <p>28. And Joshua (YHWH Is Salvation) son of Nun (Perpetuity), the servant of Moses from his youth, answered and said, “My lord Moses, restrain them!”</p>
    
    <p>29. And Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the people of the LORD (YHWH – He is) were prophets, that the LORD (YHWH – He is) would put His spirit upon them!”</p>
    
    <p>30. And Moses returned to the camp, he and the elders of Israel (He Struggles With God).</p>
    
    <p>31. And a wind went forth from the LORD (YHWH – He is) and brought quail from the sea and spread them over the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and about a day’s journey on that side, all around the camp, and about two cubits high upon the face of the earth.</p>
    
    <p>32. And the people rose all that day and all that night and all the next day and gathered the quail; the one who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.</p>
    
    <p>33. The meat was still between their teeth, not yet chewed, and the anger of the LORD (YHWH – He is) burned against the people, and the LORD (YHWH – He is) struck the people with a very great plague.</p>
    
    <p>34. And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah (Graves of Lust), for there they buried the people who had lusted.</p>
    
    <p>35. From Kibroth-hattaavah (Graves of Lust) the people journeyed to Hazeroth (Villages), and they remained at Hazeroth (Villages).</p>
