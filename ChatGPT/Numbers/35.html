    <h1>Numbers 35 - Literal Translation</h1>
    <p>1 And the LORD (YHWH – He is) spoke to Moses (Drawn Out) in the plains of Moab (From Father) by the Jordan (Descender) near Jericho (Fragrant), saying,</p>
    <p>2 "Command the sons of Israel (God Strives) that they give to the Levites (Joined) from the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in, and open land for the cities all around you shall give to the Levites (Joined).</p>
    <p>3 And the cities shall be for them to dwell in, and their open land shall be for their cattle and for their substance and for all their beasts.</p>
    <p>4 And the open land of the cities which you shall give to the Levites (Joined) shall be from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits all around.</p>
    <p>5 And you shall measure outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits, with the city in the middle; this shall be for them the open land of the cities.</p>
    <p>6 And the cities which you shall give to the Levites (Joined): six cities of refuge which you shall give for the manslayer to flee there, and besides them you shall give forty-two cities.</p>
    <p>7 All the cities which you shall give to the Levites (Joined) shall be forty-eight cities, them and their open lands.</p>
    <p>8 And the cities which you shall give from the possession of the sons of Israel (God Strives), from the many you shall increase, and from the few you shall diminish; each one according to his inheritance which they inherit shall give of his cities to the Levites (Joined).</p>
    <p>9 And the LORD (YHWH – He is) spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
    <p>10 "Speak to the sons of Israel (God Strives) and say to them, 'When you cross the Jordan (Descender) to the land of Canaan (Lowland),</p>
    <p>11 you shall appoint cities for yourselves, cities of refuge shall they be for you, that the manslayer who kills a soul unintentionally may flee there.</p>
    <p>12 And the cities shall be for you a refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer shall not die until he stands before the congregation for judgment.</p>
    <p>13 And the cities which you shall give shall be six cities of refuge for you.</p>
    <p>14 Three cities you shall give across the Jordan (Descender), and three cities you shall give in the land of Canaan (Lowland); cities of refuge shall they be.</p>
    <p>15 For the sons of Israel (God Strives) and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them shall these six cities be for refuge, for anyone to flee there who kills a soul unintentionally.</p>
    <p>16 But if he strikes him with an iron tool so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.</p>
    <p>17 And if he strikes him with a stone in hand which is able to cause death and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.</p>
    <p>18 Or if he strikes him with a wooden tool in hand which is able to cause death and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.</p>
    <p>19 The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death; when he meets him, he shall put him to death.</p>
    <p>20 And if in hatred he thrusts him or hurls at him lying in wait so that he dies,</p>
    <p>21 or in enmity strikes him with his hand so that he dies, the one who struck shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him.</p>
    <p>22 But if in suddenness without enmity he thrusts him or hurls upon him anything without lying in wait,</p>
    <p>23 or with any stone which is able to cause death, without seeing, and he causes it to fall upon him and he dies, and he was not his enemy nor sought his harm,</p>
    <p>24 then the congregation shall judge between the manslayer and the avenger of blood according to these judgments.</p>
    <p>25 And the congregation shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall return him to the city of refuge where he fled, and he shall dwell in it until the death of the high priest whom they anointed with the holy oil.</p>
    <p>26 But if the manslayer surely goes out beyond the border of the city of refuge where he fled,</p>
    <p>27 and the avenger of blood finds him outside the border of his city of refuge and the avenger of blood kills the manslayer, he has no blood-guilt.</p>
    <p>28 For he should dwell in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest, but after the death of the high priest, the manslayer shall return to the land of his possession.</p>
    <p>29 And these shall be for you a statute of judgment throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</p>
    <p>30 Whoever kills a soul, by the mouth of witnesses the murderer shall be put to death; but one witness shall not testify against a soul to cause him to die.</p>
    <p>31 And you shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death, for he shall surely be put to death.</p>
    <p>32 And you shall not take ransom for one who has fled to his city of refuge, to return to dwell in the land before the death of the priest.</p>
    <p>33 And you shall not pollute the land in which you are, for blood pollutes the land, and for the land no atonement can be made for the blood that is shed in it except by the blood of the one who sheds it.</p>
    <p>34 And you shall not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell, for I, the LORD (YHWH – He is), dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel (God Strives)."</p>
