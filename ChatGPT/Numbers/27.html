    <h1>Numbers 27 - Literal Translation</h1>
    <p><strong>1</strong> And the daughters of <strong>Zelophehad</strong> (shadow of fear), son of <strong>Hepher</strong> (shame), son of <strong>Gilead</strong> (rocky region), son of <strong>Machir</strong> (sold), son of <strong>Manasseh</strong> (causing to forget), of the families of <strong>Manasseh</strong> (causing to forget), son of <strong>Joseph</strong> (He adds), came near. And these are the names of his daughters: <strong>Mahlah</strong> (sickness), <strong>Noah</strong> (motion), <strong>Hoglah</strong> (partridge), <strong>Milcah</strong> (queen), and <strong>Tirzah</strong> (pleasing).</p>
    <p><strong>2</strong> And they stood before <strong>Moses</strong> (drawn out) and before <strong>Eleazar</strong> (God has helped) the priest, and before the leaders and all the congregation, at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, saying,</p>
    <p><strong>3</strong> "Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the midst of the congregation that gathered against the LORD (YHWH – He is) in the assembly of <strong>Korah</strong> (baldness), but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons."</p>
    <p><strong>4</strong> "Why should the name of our father be removed from the midst of his family because he had no son? Give us a possession among the brothers of our father."</p>
    <p><strong>5</strong> And <strong>Moses</strong> brought their case before the LORD (YHWH – He is).</p>
    <p><strong>6</strong> And the LORD (YHWH – He is) spoke to <strong>Moses</strong>, saying,</p>
    <p><strong>7</strong> "Rightly the daughters of <strong>Zelophehad</strong> (shadow of fear) speak. You shall surely give them a possession of inheritance among the brothers of their father, and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them."</p>
    <p><strong>8</strong> "And to the children of <strong>Israel</strong> (God contends) you shall speak, saying: ‘If a man dies and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.’"</p>
    <p><strong>9</strong> "And if he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers."</p>
    <p><strong>10</strong> "And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers."</p>
    <p><strong>11</strong> "And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his closest relative in his family, and he shall possess it. And it shall be for the children of <strong>Israel</strong> (God contends) a statute of judgment, as the LORD (YHWH – He is) commanded <strong>Moses</strong>."</p>
    <p><strong>12</strong> And the LORD (YHWH – He is) said to <strong>Moses</strong>, "Go up to this mountain of <strong>Abarim</strong> (regions beyond), and see the land that I have given to the children of <strong>Israel</strong> (God contends)."</p>
    <p><strong>13</strong> "And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as <strong>Aaron</strong> (light-bringer) your brother was gathered."</p>
    <p><strong>14</strong> "Because you rebelled against My mouth in the wilderness of <strong>Zen</strong> (flat) in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify Me at the waters before their eyes. These are the waters of <strong>Meribah</strong> (quarreling) in <strong>Kadesh</strong> (holy), in the wilderness of <strong>Zen</strong> (flat)."</p>
    <p><strong>15</strong> And <strong>Moses</strong> spoke to the LORD (YHWH – He is), saying,</p>
    <p><strong>16</strong> "Let the LORD (YHWH – He is), the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,"</p>
    <p><strong>17</strong> "Who shall go out before them and who shall come in before them, and who shall lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of the LORD (YHWH – He is) shall not be like sheep that have no shepherd."</p>
    <p><strong>18</strong> And the LORD (YHWH – He is) said to <strong>Moses</strong>, "Take for yourself <strong>Joshua</strong> (YHWH is salvation), son of <strong>Nun</strong> (continuance), a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand upon him."</p>
    <p><strong>19</strong> "And stand him before <strong>Eleazar</strong> (God has helped) the priest and before all the congregation, and command him before their eyes."</p>
    <p><strong>20</strong> "And you shall place some of your honor upon him, so that all the congregation of the children of <strong>Israel</strong> (God contends) shall listen to him."</p>
    <p><strong>21</strong> "And he shall stand before <strong>Eleazar</strong> (God has helped) the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before the LORD (YHWH – He is). At his word, they shall go out, and at his word, they shall come in, he and all the children of <strong>Israel</strong> (God contends) with him, and all the congregation."</p>
    <p><strong>22</strong> And <strong>Moses</strong> did as the LORD (YHWH – He is) commanded him. And he took <strong>Joshua</strong> (YHWH is salvation) and stood him before <strong>Eleazar</strong> (God has helped) the priest and before all the congregation.</p>
    <p><strong>23</strong> And he laid his hands upon him and commanded him, as the LORD (YHWH – He is) spoke by the hand of <strong>Moses</strong>.</p>
