    <h1>Numbers 20 - Literal Translation</h1>
    <p><strong>1</strong> And the children of <strong>Israel</strong> (God contends) came, all the congregation, to the wilderness of <strong>Sin</strong> (thorn, clay) in the first month, and the people dwelled in <strong>Kadesh</strong> (holy). And <strong>Miriam</strong> (bitter) died there, and she was buried there.</p>
    <p><strong>2</strong> And there was no water for the congregation, and they gathered against <strong>Moses</strong> (drawn out) and against <strong>Aaron</strong> (light-bringer).</p>
    <p><strong>3</strong> And the people quarreled with <strong>Moses</strong> and spoke, saying, "Oh, that we had perished when our brothers perished before the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists)!"</p>
    <p><strong>4</strong> "And why have you brought the assembly of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) to this wilderness, to die there, we and our livestock?"</p>
    <p><strong>5</strong> "And why have you brought us up from <strong>Egypt</strong> (narrow place), to bring us to this evil place? Not a place of seed, or fig, or vine, or pomegranate, and there is no water to drink!"</p>
    <p><strong>6</strong> And <strong>Moses</strong> and <strong>Aaron</strong> came from before the assembly to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and they fell on their faces, and the glory of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) appeared to them.</p>
    <p><strong>7</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) spoke to <strong>Moses</strong>, saying,</p>
    <p><strong>8</strong> "Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you and <strong>Aaron</strong> your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, and it shall give its water. And you shall bring out for them water from the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their livestock."</p>
    <p><strong>9</strong> And <strong>Moses</strong> took the rod from before the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) as He commanded him.</p>
    <p><strong>10</strong> And <strong>Moses</strong> and <strong>Aaron</strong> gathered the assembly before the rock, and he said to them, "Hear now, you rebels, shall we bring out water for you from this rock?"</p>
    <p><strong>11</strong> And <strong>Moses</strong> lifted his hand and struck the rock with his rod twice, and much water came out, and the congregation drank, and their livestock.</p>
    <p><strong>12</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) said to <strong>Moses</strong> and to <strong>Aaron</strong>, "Because you did not believe in Me, to sanctify Me before the eyes of the children of <strong>Israel</strong>, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them."</p>
    <p><strong>13</strong> These are the waters of <strong>Meribah</strong> (quarreling), because the children of <strong>Israel</strong> quarreled with the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists), and He was sanctified through them.</p>
    <p><strong>14</strong> And <strong>Moses</strong> sent messengers from <strong>Kadesh</strong> (holy) to the king of <strong>Edom</strong> (red), "Thus says your brother <strong>Israel</strong>: You know all the hardship that has found us."</p>
    <p><strong>15</strong> "And our fathers went down to <strong>Egypt</strong> (narrow place), and we dwelled in <strong>Egypt</strong> (narrow place) many days, and the Egyptians did evil to us and to our fathers."</p>
    <p><strong>16</strong> "And we cried out to the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists), and He heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us out from <strong>Egypt</strong> (narrow place), and now we are in <strong>Kadesh</strong> (holy), a city on the edge of your border."</p>
    <p><strong>17</strong> "Let us please pass through your land; we shall not pass through field or vineyard, and we shall not drink well water. On the kingâ€™s road we shall go; we shall not turn right or left until we pass through your border."</p>
    <p><strong>18</strong> But <strong>Edom</strong> (red) said to him, "You shall not pass through me, lest I come out against you with the sword."</p>
    <p><strong>19</strong> And the children of <strong>Israel</strong> said to him, "On the highway we shall go up, and if we drink your water, I and my livestock, then I shall give its price. Only let me pass on foot; nothing more."</p>
    <p><strong>20</strong> But he said, "You shall not pass." And <strong>Edom</strong> (red) came out against him with a heavy people and a strong hand.</p>
    <p><strong>21</strong> And <strong>Edom</strong> (red) refused to allow <strong>Israel</strong> to pass through his border, and <strong>Israel</strong> turned away from him.</p>
    <p><strong>22</strong> And they journeyed from <strong>Kadesh</strong> (holy), and the children of <strong>Israel</strong>, all the congregation, came to <strong>Mount Hor</strong> (mountain of the mountain).</p>
    <p><strong>23</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) spoke to <strong>Moses</strong> and <strong>Aaron</strong> at <strong>Mount Hor</strong> (mountain of the mountain) on the border of the land of <strong>Edom</strong> (red), saying,</p>
    <p><strong>24</strong> "Let <strong>Aaron</strong> be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter the land that I have given to the children of <strong>Israel</strong>, because you rebelled against My mouth at the waters of <strong>Meribah</strong> (quarreling)."</p>
    <p><strong>25</strong> "Take <strong>Aaron</strong> and <strong>Eleazar</strong> (God has helped) his son, and bring them up to <strong>Mount Hor</strong> (mountain of the mountain)."</p>
    <p><strong>26</strong> "And strip <strong>Aaron</strong> of his garments, and clothe <strong>Eleazar</strong> (God has helped) his son with them, and <strong>Aaron</strong> shall be gathered and die there."</p>
    <p><strong>27</strong> And <strong>Moses</strong> did as the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) commanded, and they went up to <strong>Mount Hor</strong> (mountain of the mountain) before the eyes of all the congregation.</p>
    <p><strong>28</strong> And <strong>Moses</strong> stripped <strong>Aaron</strong> of his garments and clothed <strong>Eleazar</strong> (God has helped) his son with them, and <strong>Aaron</strong> died there on the top of the mountain. And <strong>Moses</strong> and <strong>Eleazar</strong> (God has helped) came down from the mountain.</p>
    <p><strong>29</strong> And all the congregation saw that <strong>Aaron</strong> had died, and they wept for <strong>Aaron</strong> thirty days, all the house of <strong>Israel</strong> (God contends).</p>
