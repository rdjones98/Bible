    <h1>Exodus 25</h1>

    <p>1. The LORD (YHWH - "the LORD") said to Moses (Mosheh - "Drawn out"),</p>

    <p>2. â€œSpeak to the people of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God"), that they take for me a contribution; from every man whose heart moves him, you shall receive the contribution for me.</p>

    <p>3. And this is the contribution that you shall receive from them: gold, silver, and bronze,</p>

    <p>4. blue, purple, and scarlet, yarn, fine linen, goat hair,</p>

    <p>5. tanned ram skins, another skin (tahash - "meaning unknown"), acacia wood,</p>

    <p>6. oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,</p>

    <p>7. onyx stones and stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate.</p>

    <p>8. And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in their midst.</p>

    <p>9. Exactly as I show you concerning the pattern of the tabernacle and of all its furniture, so you shall make it.</p>

    <p>10. They shall make an ark of acacia wood; two and a half cubits shall be its length, a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height.</p>

    <p>11. You shall overlay it with pure gold, inside and outside, and you shall make on it a molding of gold around it.</p>

    <p>12. You shall cast four rings of gold for it and put them on its four feet, two rings on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.</p>

    <p>13. You shall make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.</p>

    <p>14. And you shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry the ark.</p>

    <p>15. The poles shall remain in the rings of the ark; they shall not be taken from it.</p>

    <p>16. And you shall put into the ark the testimony that I shall give you.</p>

    <p>17. You shall make a mercy seat of pure gold; two and a half cubits shall be its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth.</p>

    <p>18. And you shall make two cherubim of gold; of hammered work shall you make them, on the two ends of the mercy seat.</p>

    <p>19. Make one cherub on the one end, and one cherub on the other end; of one piece with the mercy seat shall you make the cherubim on its two ends.</p>

    <p>20. The cherubim shall spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings. Their faces shall be toward each other; 
	toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.</p>

    <p>21. And you shall put the mercy seat on the top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the testimony that I shall give you.</p>

    <p>22. There I will meet with you, and from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim that are on the ark of the testimony, 
	I will speak with you about all that I will give you in commandment for the people of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God").</p>

    <p>23. You shall make a table of acacia wood; two cubits shall be its length, a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height.</p>

    <p>24. You shall overlay it with pure gold, and make a molding of gold around it.</p>

    <p>25. And you shall make for it a rim of a handbreadth around it, and you shall make a golden molding for the rim around it.</p>

    <p>26. You shall make for it four rings of gold and put the rings on the four corners at its four legs.</p>

    <p>27. Close to the frame shall the rings be, as holders for the poles to carry the table.</p>

    <p>28. You shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold, and the table shall be carried with them.</p>

    <p>29. And you shall make its dishes and its pans and its flagons) and its bowls with which to pour, of pure gold you shall make them.</p>

    <p>30. And you shall set the bread of the Presence (panim - "face") on the table before me always.</p>

	its cups, its calyxes, and its flowers shall be of one piece with it.</p>

    <p>35. And a calyx shall be under two branches of the same, and a calyx under two branches of the other, for the six branches going out of the lampstand.</p>

    <p>36. Their calyxes and their branches shall be of one piece with it; the whole of it shall be a single hammered piece of pure gold.</p>
