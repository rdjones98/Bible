    <h1>Exodus 29</h1>
<p><strong>1</strong> And this is the thing that you shall do to them, to sanctify them to minister as priests to Me (Elohim, God): take one bull, son of the herd, and two rams, perfect ones,
</p><p><strong>2</strong> and unleavened bread, and unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil; of fine wheat flour you shall make them.
</p><p><strong>3</strong> And you shall put them in one basket and bring them near in the basket, and the bull and the two rams.
</p><p><strong>4</strong> And Aaron (Light-bringer) and his sons you shall bring near to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and you shall wash them with water.
</p><p><strong>5</strong> And you shall take the garments, and you shall clothe Aaron (Light-bringer) with the tunic and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod and the breastplate, and gird him with the band of the ephod.
</p><p><strong>6</strong> And you shall place the turban on his head and put the holy crown upon the turban.
</p><p><strong>7</strong> And you shall take the anointing oil and pour on his head and anoint him.
</p><p><strong>8</strong> And his sons you shall bring near and clothe them with tunics.
</p><p><strong>9</strong> And you shall gird them with a belt, Aaron (Light-bringer) and his sons, and bind high hats on them, and the priesthood shall be theirs for an everlasting statute. And you shall fill the hand of Aaron (Light-bringer) and the hand of his sons.
</p><p><strong>10</strong> And you shall bring near the bull before the Tent of Meeting, and Aaron (Light-bringer) and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the bull.
</p><p><strong>11</strong> And you shall slaughter the bull before YHWH (The Eternal), at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
</p><p><strong>12</strong> And you shall take of the blood of the bull and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and all the blood you shall pour at the base of the altar.
</p><p><strong>13</strong> And you shall take all the fat that covers the innards, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that is upon them, and burn them on the altar.
</p><p><strong>14</strong> And the flesh of the bull, and its skin, and its dung, you shall burn with fire outside the camp; it is a sin-offering.
</p><p><strong>15</strong> And the one ram you shall take, and Aaron (Light-bringer) and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram.
</p><p><strong>16</strong> And you shall slaughter the ram, and you shall take its blood and sprinkle on the altar all around.
</p><p><strong>17</strong> And the ram you shall cut into its pieces, and you shall wash its innards and its legs, and place them upon its pieces and upon its head.
</p><p><strong>18</strong> And you shall burn all the ram on the altar; it is a burnt-offering to YHWH (The Eternal), a soothing aroma, an offering made by fire to YHWH (The Eternal).
</p><p><strong>19</strong> And you shall take the second ram, and Aaron (Light-bringer) and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram.
</p><p><strong>20</strong> And you shall slaughter the ram, and you shall take of its blood and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron (Light-bringer) and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood on the altar all around.
</p><p><strong>21</strong> And you shall take of the blood that is on the altar and of the anointing oil and sprinkle on Aaron (Light-bringer) and on his garments and on his sons and on the garments of his sons with him, and he shall be holy, and his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
</p><p><strong>22</strong> And you shall take from the ram the fat and the fat tail, and the fat that covers the innards, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that is upon them, and the right thigh, for it is a ram of ordination.
</p><p><strong>23</strong> And one loaf of bread and one cake of oil bread and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread that is before YHWH (The Eternal).
</p><p><strong>24</strong> And you shall place all on the palms of Aaron (Light-bringer) and on the palms of his sons, and wave them as a wave offering before YHWH (The Eternal).
</p><p><strong>25</strong> And you shall take them from their hands and burn them on the altar upon the burnt-offering, for a soothing aroma before YHWH (The Eternal), an offering made by fire to YHWH (The Eternal).
</p><p><strong>26</strong> And you shall take the breast from the ram of Aaronâ€™s (Light-bringer) ordination and wave it as a wave offering before YHWH (The Eternal), and it shall be your portion.
</p><p><strong>27</strong> And you shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution which was waved and which was lifted from the ram of ordination, from that which was for Aaron (Light-bringer) and for his sons.
</p><p><strong>28</strong> And it shall be for Aaron (Light-bringer) and for his sons as an everlasting statute from the sons of Israel, for it is a contribution, and it shall be a contribution from the sons of Israel from their peace-offerings, their contribution to YHWH (The Eternal).
</p><p><strong>29</strong> And the holy garments that are for Aaron (Light-bringer) shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them and to fill their hand in them.
</p><p><strong>30</strong> Seven days shall the priest who is in his place from his sons wear them, when he comes to the Tent of Meeting to minister in the Holy Place.
</p><p><strong>31</strong> And you shall take the ram of ordination and boil its flesh in a holy place.
</p><p><strong>32</strong> And Aaron (Light-bringer) and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is in the basket at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
</p><p><strong>33</strong> And they shall eat those things by which atonement was made to fill their hand, to sanctify them, but a stranger shall not eat, for they are holy.
</p><p><strong>34</strong> And if ought of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.</p>
</p><p><strong>35</strong> And thus shall you do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded you: seven days shall you consecrate them.</p>
</p><p><strong>36</strong> And you shall offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and you shall cleanse the altar, when you have made an atonement for it, and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.</p>
</p><p><strong>37</strong> Seven days you shall make an atonement for the altar and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever touches the altar shall be holy.</p>
</p><p><strong>38</strong> Now this is that which you shall offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.</p>
</p><p><strong>39</strong> The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb you shall offer at even:</p>
</p><p><strong>40</strong> And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.</p>
</p><p><strong>41</strong> And the other lamb you shall offer at even, and shall do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the Lord (YHWH - He is).</p>
</p><p><strong>42</strong> This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord (YHWH - He is): where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.</p>
</p><p><strong>43</strong> And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by My glory.</p>
</p><p><strong>44</strong> And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to Me in the priest's office.</p>
</p><p><strong>45</strong> And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God (Elohim). </p>

</p><p><strong>46</strong> And they shall know that I am the Lord (YHWH - He is) their God (Elohim), who brought them out from the land of Egypt to dwell among them; I am the Lord (YHWH - He is) their God (Elohim).
