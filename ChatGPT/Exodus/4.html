    <h1>Exodus 4</h1>

    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    Then Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) answered, "But behold, they will not believe me or listen to my voice, for they will say, 'The Lord (YHWH - Lord) did not appear (Ra'ah - appear) to you.'" </p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    The Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to him, "What is that in your hand?" He said, "A staff." </p>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    And He said, "Throw it on the ground." So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent (Tanin - serpent), and Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) ran (Nadad - ran) from it. </p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    But the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "Put out your hand and catch (Chazak - take hold of) it by the tail (Zon - tail)." So he put out his hand and caught (Chazak - took hold of) it, and it became a staff in his hand. </p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    "That they may believe that the Lord (YHWH - Lord) the God (Elohim - God) of their fathers, the God (Elohim - God) of Abraham (Avraham - father of many), the God (Elohim - God) of Isaac (Yitzhak - laughter), and the God (Elohim - God) of Jacob (Yaakov - supplanted), has appeared (Ra'ah - appeared) to you." </p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    Again, the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to him, "Put your hand inside your cloak." And he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous (Tzara'at - leprous), like snow (Sheleg - snow). </p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    Then God (Elohim - God) said, "Put your hand back inside your cloak." So he put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh (Basar - flesh). </p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    "If they will not believe you or listen to the first sign, they may believe the latter sign. </p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    If they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, you shall take some water from the Nile and pour (Shafak - pour) it on the dry ground (Yabashah - dry ground), and the water that you take from the Nile will become blood (Damm - blood) on the dry ground (Yabashah - dry ground)." </p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    But Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) said to the Lord (YHWH - Lord), "O my Lord (Adonai - Lord), I am not eloquent (Ish - man), either in the past (Bikdeh - before) or since you have spoken (Diber - spoken) to your servant (Eved - servant), but I am slow of speech (Kaved - heavy) and of tongue (Lashon - tongue)." </p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    The Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to him, "Who has made man's (Adam - man) mouth? Who makes (Asah - makes) him mute or deaf, or seeing or blind? Is it not I, the Lord (YHWH - Lord)? </p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach (Yarah - teach) you what you shall spea." </p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    But he said, "O my Lord (Adonai - Lord), please send someone else (Acher - other)." </p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    Then the anger (Af - anger) of the Lord (YHWH - Lord) was kindled against Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and he said, "Is there not Aaron (Aharon - exalted) your brother, the Levite (Levi - joined)? I know that he can spea well (Tov - well). Behold, he is coming out (Yatsa - coming) to meet (Qara - meet) you, and when he sees (Ra'ah - sees) you, he will be glad (Sameach - glad) in his heart. </p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    You shall spea to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach (Yarah - teach) you both what to do. </p>

    <p><strong>16. </strong>
    He shall spea for you to the people, and he shall be your mouth, and you shall be as God (Elohim - God) to him. </p>

    <p><strong>17. </strong>
    And take in your hand this staff with which you shall do the signs." </p>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) went back to Jethro (Yitro - His excellency), his father-in-law (Choten - father-in-law), and said to him, "Please let me go back to my brothers (Ach - brothers) in Egypt, to see whether they are still alive (Chayah - alive)." And Jethro (Yitro - His excellency) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "Go in peace (Shalom - peace)." </p>

    <p><strong>19. </strong>
    And the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) in Midian (Midyan - strife), "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead (Muth - dead)." </p>

    <p><strong>20. </strong>
    So Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) took his wife (Ishto - wife) and his sons (Banim - sons) and had them ride on a donkey, and went back (Shuv - returned) to the land of Egypt. And Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) took the staff of God (Elohim - God) in his hand. </p>

    <p><strong>21. </strong>
    And the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the miracles that I have put (Natan - given) in your power, but I will harden (Chazaq - harden) his heart, so that he will not let the people go. </p>

    <p><strong>22. </strong>
    Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the Lord (YHWH - Lord), Israel (Yisrael - God contends) is my firstborn son (Ben - son), </p>
