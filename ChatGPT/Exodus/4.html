    <h1>Exodus 4</h1>

    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    Then Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) answered (Anah - answered), "But behold, they will not believe (Aman - believe) me or listen to my voice (Kol - voice), for they will say, 'The Lord (YHWH - Lord) did not appear (Ra'ah - appear) to you.'" </p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    The Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to him, "What is that in your hand?" He said, "A staff (Matteh - staff)." </p>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    And He said, "Throw it on the ground (Erets - ground)." So he threw it on the ground (Erets - ground), and it became a serpent (Tanin - serpent), and Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) ran (Nadad - ran) from it. </p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    But the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "Put out your hand and catch (Chazak - take hold of) it by the tail (Zon - tail)." So he put out his hand and caught (Chazak - took hold of) it, and it became a staff (Matteh - staff) in his hand. </p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    "That they may believe (Aman - believe) that the Lord (YHWH - Lord) the God (Elohim - God) of their fathers (Avot - fathers), the God (Elohim - God) of Abraham (Avraham - father of many), the God (Elohim - God) of Isaac (Yitzhak - laughter), and the God (Elohim - God) of Jacob (Yaakov - supplanted), has appeared (Ra'ah - appeared) to you." </p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    Again, the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to him, "Put your hand inside your cloak (Chalokeh - cloak)." And he put his hand inside his cloak (Chalokeh - cloak), and when he took it out (Yatsa - took it out), behold, his hand was leprous (Tzara'at - leprous), like snow (Sheleg - snow). </p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    Then God (Elohim - God) said, "Put your hand back inside your cloak (Chalokeh - cloak)." So he put his hand back inside his cloak (Chalokeh - cloak), and when he took it out (Yatsa - took it out), behold, it was restored (Shav - restored) like the rest of his flesh (Basar - flesh). </p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    "If they will not believe (Aman - believe) you or listen to the first sign (Oth - sign), they may believe (Aman - believe) the latter sign (Oth - sign). </p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    If they will not believe (Aman - believe) even these two signs or listen to your voice (Kol - voice), you shall take some water from the Nile (Yor - river) and pour (Shafak - pour) it on the dry ground (Yabashah - dry ground), and the water that you take from the Nile (Yor - river) will become blood (Damm - blood) on the dry ground (Yabashah - dry ground)." </p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    But Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) said to the Lord (YHWH - Lord), "O my Lord (Adonai - Lord), I am not eloquent (Ish - man), either in the past (Bikdeh - before) or since you have spoken (Diber - spoken) to your servant (Eved - servant), but I am slow of speech (Kaved - heavy) and of tongue (Lashon - tongue)." </p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    The Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to him, "Who has made (Asah - made) man's (Adam - man) mouth (Peh - mouth)? Who makes (Asah - makes) him mute (Cheresh - mute) or deaf (Kheresh - deaf), or seeing (Ra'ah - seeing) or blind (Iver - blind)? Is it not I, the Lord (YHWH - Lord)? </p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    Now therefore go (Lech - go), and I will be with your mouth (Peh - mouth) and teach (Yarah - teach) you what you shall speak (Daber - speak)." </p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    But he said, "O my Lord (Adonai - Lord), please send (Shalach - send) someone else (Acher - other)." </p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    Then the anger (Af - anger) of the Lord (YHWH - Lord) was kindled (Charah - kindled) against Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and he said, "Is there not Aaron (Aharon - exalted) your brother, the Levite (Levi - joined)? I know that he can speak (Daber - speak) well (Tov - well). Behold, he is coming out (Yatsa - coming) to meet (Qara - meet) you, and when he sees (Ra'ah - sees) you, he will be glad (Sameach - glad) in his heart. </p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    You shall speak (Daber - speak) to him and put the words (Dabar - words) in his mouth (Pe - mouth), and I will be with your mouth (Pe - mouth) and with his mouth (Pe - mouth) and will teach (Yarah - teach) you both what to do. </p>

    <p><strong>16. </strong>
    He shall speak (Daber - speak) for you to the people, and he shall be your mouth (Pe - mouth), and you shall be as God (Elohim - God) to him. </p>

    <p><strong>17. </strong>
    And take (Lakach - take) in your hand this staff (Matteh - staff) with which you shall do the signs." </p>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) went back (Shuv - went back) to Jethro (Yitro - His excellency), his father-in-law (Choten - father-in-law), and said to him, "Please let me go back (Shuv - return) to my brothers (Ach - brothers) in Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt), to see whether they are still alive (Chayah - alive)." And Jethro (Yitro - His excellency) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "Go (Lech - go) in peace (Shalom - peace)." </p>

    <p><strong>19. </strong>
    And the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) in Midian (Midyan - strife), "Go (Lech - go) back (Shuv - return) to Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt), for all the men (Anashim - men) who were seeking your life (Chayah - life) are dead (Muth - dead)." </p>

    <p><strong>20. </strong>
    So Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) took (Lakach - took) his wife (Ishto - wife) and his sons (Banim - sons) and had them ride (Rakav - ride) on a donkey (Chamor - donkey), and went back (Shuv - returned) to the land of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt). And Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) took (Lakach - took) the staff (Matteh - staff) of God (Elohim - God) in his hand. </p>

    <p><strong>21. </strong>
    And the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "When you go back (Shuv - return) to Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt), see that you do before Pharaoh all the miracles that I have put (Natan - given) in your power, but I will harden (Chazaq - harden) his heart, so that he will not let the people go (Shalach - send). </p>

    <p><strong>22. </strong>
    Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says (Amar - says) the Lord (YHWH - Lord), Israel (Yisrael - God contends) is my firstborn (Bekhor - firstborn) son (Ben - son), </p>
