    <h1>Exodus 5 - Straightforward Translation</h1>

    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    Afterward Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - exalted) went and said to Pharaoh, "Thus says (Amar - says) the Lord (YHWH - Lord), the God (Elohim - God) of Israel (Yisrael - God contends), 'Let my people go (Shalach - send) that they may hold (Chagag - keep) a feast (Chag - feast) to me in the wilderness (Midbar - wilderness).'" </p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    But Pharaoh said, "Who is the Lord (YHWH - Lord), that I should obey (Shama - obey) his voice (Kol - voice) and let Israel (Yisrael - God contends) go (Shalach - send)? I do not know the Lord (YHWH - Lord), and moreover, I will not let Israel (Yisrael - God contends) go (Shalach - send)." </p>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    Then they said, "The God (Elohim - God) of the Hebrews (Ivri - Hebrews) has met (Paga - met) with us. Please let us go (Shalach - send) a three-day journey (Derekh - journey) into the wilderness (Midbar - wilderness) that we may sacrifice (Zabach - sacrifice) to the Lord (YHWH - Lord) our God (Elohim - God), lest he fall upon us with pestilence (Dever - pestilence) or with the sword (Cherev - sword)." </p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    But the king (Melech - king) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt) said to them, "Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - exalted), why do you take the people away (Asah - away) from their work (Avodah - work)? Get back (Shuv - return) to your burdens (Sevel - burdens)." </p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    And Pharaoh said, "Behold, the people of the land are now many (Rav - many), and you make them rest (Shabath - rest) from their burdens (Sevel - burdens)."</p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    The same day (Yom - day) Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters (Sareh - officers) of the people and their foremen (Shoter - overseers), "You shall no longer give the people straw (Teven - straw) to make bricks (Leven - bricks), as in the past (Re'shon - former days); let them go (Shalach - send) and gather straw (Teven - straw) for themselves. </p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    But the number (Mispar - number) of bricks (Leven - bricks) that they made (Asah - made) in the past (Re'shon - former days) you shall impose (Sam - impose) on them; you shall by no means reduce it, for they are idle (Sha'ar - lazy); therefore they cry (Zaaq - cry), 'Let us go (Shalach - send) and offer (Zabach - offer) sacrifice (Zabach - sacrifice) to our God (Elohim - God).'</p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    Let heavier (Kaved - heavy) work be laid on the men (Anashim - men), that they may labor (Avad - work) at it and pay no regard (Shav - regard) to lying words (Sheqer - falsehoods)."</p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    So the taskmasters (Sareh - officers) and the foremen (Shoter - overseers) of the people went out and said to the people, "Thus says (Amar - says) Pharaoh, 'I will not give you straw (Teven - straw). </p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    Go and get your straw (Teven - straw) yourselves wherever you can find (Matsa - find) it, but your work (Avodah - work) will not be reduced (Sha'ar - diminished) in the least.'"</p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    So the people were scattered (Pazar - scattered) throughout all the land of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt) to gather (Asaph - gather) stubble (Kash - stubble) for straw (Teven - straw). </p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    The taskmasters (Sareh - officers) were urgent (Chazar - urgent), saying, "Complete (Shalam - complete) your work (Avodah - work), your daily task (Dabar - task), each day (Yom - day), as when there was straw (Teven - straw)." </p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    And the foremen (Shoter - overseers) of the people were beaten (Nakah - beaten) and were asked (Sh'alah - asked), "Why have you not done (Asah - done) your task (Avodah - task) in making bricks (Leven - bricks) as in the past (Re'shon - former days)?" </p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    Then the foremen (Shoter - overseers) of the people came and cried out (Za'aq - cried out) to Pharaoh, "Why do you treat (Asah - treat) your servants (Eved - servants) like this? </p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    No straw (Teven - straw) is given to your servants (Eved - servants), yet they say to us, 'Make bricks (Leven - bricks)!' And behold, your servants (Eved - servants) are beaten (Nakah - beaten), but the fault (Avon - guilt) is in your own people."</p>

    <p><strong>16. </strong>
    But he said (Amar - said), "You are idle (Sha'ar - lazy), lazy (Sha'ar - lazy)! That is why you say, 'Let us go (Shalach - send) and sacrifice (Zabach - offer) to the Lord (YHWH - Lord).'</p>

    <p><strong>17. </strong>
    Go now and work (Avad - work), for no straw (Teven - straw) will be given to you, but you must still deliver (Natan - deliver) the same number (Mispar - number) of bricks (Leven - bricks)." </p>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    The foremen (Shoter - overseers) of the people went out and they met (Paga - met) Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - exalted), who were waiting (Chakah - waiting) for them, as they came out from Pharaoh; </p>

    <p><strong>19. </strong>
    And they said (Amar - said) to them, "The Lord (YHWH - Lord) look upon (Paga - look) you and judge (Shaphat - judge), because you have made (Asah - made) us stink (Qe'ah - stink) in the sight (Ayne - eyes) of Pharaoh and his servants (Eved - servants), and have put (Natan - put) a sword (Cherev - sword) in their hand to kill (Harag - kill) us." </p>

    <p><strong>20. </strong>
    Then Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) turned (Shuv - turned) to the Lord (YHWH - Lord) and said (Amar - said), "O Lord (Adonai - Lord), why have you done (Asah - done) evil (Ra'ah - evil) to this people? Why did you ever send (Shalach - send) me? </p>

    <p><strong>21. </strong>
    For since I came (Bo - came) to Pharaoh to speak in your name (Shem - name), he has done (Asah - done) evil (Ra'ah - evil) to this people, and you have not delivered (Natsal - saved) your people at all." </p>
