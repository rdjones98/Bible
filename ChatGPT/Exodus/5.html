  <h1>Exodus (Shemot - Names) Chapter 5</h1>

  <p>1 Afterward Moses (Moshe - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - light bringer) went and said to Pharaoh (Par'oh - great house), "This is what the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists), the God (Elohim - God) of Israel (Yisrael - he struggles with God), says: 'Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the wilderness.'"</p>

  <p>2 Pharaoh said, "Who is the Lord, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the Lord and I will not let Israel go."</p>

  <p>3 Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God, or he may strike us with plague or with the sword."</p>

  <p>4 But the king of Egypt said, "Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!"</p>

  <p>5 And Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working."</p>

  <p>6 That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people:</p>

  <p>7 "You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw.</p>

  <p>8 But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don’t reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'</p>

  <p>9 Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies."</p>

  <p>10 Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people, "This is what Pharaoh says: I will not give you any straw.</p>

  <p>11 Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all."</p>

  <p>12 So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.</p>

  <p>13 The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, "Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw."</p>

  <p>14 And Pharaoh’s slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed, demanding, "Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?"</p>

  <p>15 Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: "Why have you treated your servants this way?</p>

  <p>16 No straw is given to your servants, yet we are told, 'Make bricks!' Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people."</p>

  <p>17 Pharaoh said, "Lazy! That’s what you are—lazy! That is why you keep saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.'</p>

  <p>18 Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks."</p>

  <p>19 The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, "You must not reduce the number of bricks required of you each day."</p>

  <p>20 When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,</p>

  <p>21 and they said, "May the Lord look on you and judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us."</p>

  <p>22 Moses returned to the Lord and said, "Why, Lord (Adonai - my Lord), why have you brought trouble on this people? Is this why you sent me?</p>

  <p>23 Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all."</p>
