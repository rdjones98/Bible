    <h1>Exodus 5</h1>

    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    Afterward Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - exalted) went and said to Pharaoh, "Thus says the Lord (YHWH - Lord), the God (Elohim - God) of Israel (Yisrael - God contends), 'Let my people go that they may hold (Chagag - keep) a feast (Chag - feast) to me in the wilderness (Midbar - wilderness).'" </p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    But Pharaoh said, "Who is the Lord (YHWH - Lord), that I should obe his voice and let Israel (Yisrael - God contends) go? I do not know the Lord (YHWH - Lord), and moreover, I will not let Israel (Yisrael - God contends) go." </p>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    Then they said, "The God (Elohim - God) of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go a three-day journey (Derekh - journey) into the wilderness (Midbar - wilderness) that we may sacrifice (Zabach - sacrifice) to the Lord (YHWH - Lord) our God (Elohim - God), lest he fall upon us with pestilence (Dever - pestilence) or with the sword (Cherev - sword)." </p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    But the king of Egypt said to them, "Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - exalted), why do you take the people away from their work? Get back to your burdens." </p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    And Pharaoh said, "Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest (Shabath - rest) from their burdens."</p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters (Sareh - officers) of the people and their foremen (Shoter - overseers), "You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as in the past (Re'shon - former days); let them go and gather straw for themselves. </p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    But the number of bricks that they made in the past (Re'shon - former days) you shall impose on them; you shall by no means reduce it, for they are idle; therefore they cry (Zaaq - cry), 'Let us go and offer (Zabach - offer) sacrifice (Zabach - sacrifice) to our God (Elohim - God).'</p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    Let heavier (Kaved - heavy) work be laid on the men, that they may labor (Avad - work) at it and pay no regard (Shav - regard) to lying words (Sheqer - falsehoods)."</p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    So the taskmasters (Sareh - officers) and the foremen (Shoter - overseers) of the people went out and said to the people, "Thus says Pharaoh, 'I will not give you straw. </p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    Go and get your straw yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced (Sha'ar - diminished) in the least.'"</p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    So the people were scattered (Pazar - scattered) throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. </p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    The taskmasters (Sareh - officers) were urgent, saying, "Complete (Shalam - complete) your work, your daily task, each day, as when there was straw." </p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    And the foremen (Shoter - overseers) of the people were beaten and were asked, "Why have you not done your task in making bricks as in the past (Re'shon - former days)?" </p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    Then the foremen (Shoter - overseers) of the people came and cried out to Pharaoh, "Why do you treat your servants like this? </p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, 'Make bricks!' And behold, your servants are beaten, but the fault (Avon - guilt) is in your own people."</p>

    <p><strong>16. </strong>
    But he said, "You are idle, lazy! That is why you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice (Zabach - offer) to the Lord (YHWH - Lord).'</p>

    <p><strong>17. </strong>
    Go now and work (Avad - work), for no straw will be given to you, but you must still deliver (Natan - deliver) the same number of bricks." </p>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    The foremen (Shoter - overseers) of the people went out and they met Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - exalted), who were waiting (Chakah - waiting) for them, as they came out from Pharaoh; </p>

    <p><strong>19. </strong>
    And they said to them, "The Lord (YHWH - Lord) look upon you and judge, because you have made us stink (Qe'ah - stink) in the sight (Ayne - eyes) of Pharaoh and his servants, and have put (Natan - put) a sword (Cherev - sword) in their hand to kill us." </p>

    <p><strong>20. </strong>
    Then Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) turned (Shuv - turned) to the Lord (YHWH - Lord) and said, "O Lord (Adonai - Lord), why have you done evil to this people? Why did you ever send me? </p>

    <p><strong>21. </strong>
    For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people, and you have not delivered (Natsal - saved) your people at all." </p>
