    <h1>Exodus 24</h1>

    <p>1. And He said to Moses (Mosheh - "Drawn out"), “Come up to the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD"), you and Aaron (Aharon - "High mountain"), Nadab (Nadav - "generosity") 
	and Abihu (Avihu - "my father is he"), and seventy of the elders of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God") and worship from afar.</p>

    <p>2. Moses alone shall come near to the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD"), but the others shall not come near, and the people shall not go up with him.”</p>

    <p>3. Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD") and all the rules (mishpatim - "judgments"). 
	And all the people answered with one voice and said, “All the words that the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD") has spoken we will do.”</p>

    <p>4. And Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD"). He rose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot (tachat - "under") 
	of the mountain and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God").</p>

    <p>5. And he sent young men of the people of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God"), who offered burnt offerings and 
	sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD").</p>

    <p>6. And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he threw against the altar.</p>

    <p>7. Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people. And they said, “All that the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD") has spoken we will do, 
	and we will be obedient.”</p>

    <p>8. And Moses took the blood and threw it on the people and said, “Behold, the blood of the covenant that the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD") has made with you in accordance 
	with all these words.”</p>

    <p>9. Then Moses and Aaron and Nadab (Nadav - "generosity") and Abihu (Avihu - "my father is he") and seventy of the elders of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God") 
	went up,</p>

    <p>10. and they saw the God (Elohim - "God") of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God"). There was under His feet as it were a pavement of
	sapphire, like the very heaven for clearness.</p>

    <p>11. And He did not lay His hand on the chief menof the people of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God"); they beheld God (Elohim - "God"), 
	and ate and drank.</p>

    <p>12. The LORD (YHWH - "the LORD") said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain and wait there, that I may give you the tablets of stone, 
	with the law (torah - "instruction") and the commandment, which I have written for their instruction.”</p>

    <p>13. So Moses rose with his assistant (mesharet - "servant") Joshua (Yehoshua - "YHWH is salvation") and Moses went up into the mountain of God (Elohim - "God").</p>

    <p>14. And he said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we return to you. And behold, Aaron and Hur (Chur - "free man") are with you. 
	Whoever has a dispute let him go to them.”</p>

    <p>15. Then Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.</p>

    <p>16. The glory of the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD") dwelt on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And on the seventh day
	He called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud.</p>

    <p>17. Now the appearance of the glory of the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD") was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the sight 
	of the people of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God").</p>

    <p>18. Moses entered the cloud and went up on the mountain. And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.</p>
