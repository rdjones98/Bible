    <h1>Exodus 24</h1>

    <p>1. And He said to Moses (Mosheh - "Drawn out"), “Come up to the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD"), you and Aaron (Aharon - "High mountain"), Nadab (Nadav - "generosity") and Abihu (Avihu - "my father is he"), and seventy (shiv'im - "seventy") of the elders (zekenim - "elders") of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God") and worship (shachah - "worship") from afar.</p>

    <p>2. Moses alone shall come near to the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD"), but the others shall not come near, and the people (am - "people") shall not go up with him.”</p>

    <p>3. Moses came and told the people (am - "people") all the words (davar - "words") of the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD") and all the rules (mishpatim - "judgments"). And all the people (am - "people") answered with one voice (qol - "voice") and said, “All the words (davar - "words") that the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD") has spoken we will do.”</p>

    <p>4. And Moses wrote down all the words (davar - "words") of the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD"). He rose early in the morning and built an altar (mizbeach - "altar") at the foot (tachat - "under") of the mountain (har - "mountain") and twelve pillars (matzevah - "pillars"), according to the twelve tribes (shivtei - "tribes") of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God").</p>

    <p>5. And he sent young men (na'arim - "young men") of the people (am - "people") of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God"), who offered burnt offerings (olah - "burnt offering") and sacrificed peace offerings (shelem - "peace offerings") of oxen (baqar - "oxen") to the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD").</p>

    <p>6. And Moses took half of the blood (dam - "blood") and put it in basins (cappot - "basins"), and half of the blood (dam - "blood") he threw against the altar (mizbeach - "altar").</p>

    <p>7. Then he took the Book (sefer - "book") of the Covenant (berit - "covenant") and read it in the hearing of the people (am - "people"). And they said, “All that the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD") has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient.”</p>

    <p>8. And Moses took the blood (dam - "blood") and threw it on the people (am - "people") and said, “Behold (hineh - "behold"), the blood (dam - "blood") of the covenant (berit - "covenant") that the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD") has made with you in accordance with all these words (davar - "words").”</p>

    <p>9. Then Moses and Aaron and Nadab (Nadav - "generosity") and Abihu (Avihu - "my father is he") and seventy (shiv'im - "seventy") of the elders (zekenim - "elders") of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God") went up,</p>

    <p>10. and they saw the God (Elohim - "God") of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God"). There was under His feet (raglayim - "feet") as it were a pavement (rachel - "pavement") of sapphire (sapir - "sapphire stone"), like the very heaven (shamayim - "heaven") for clearness.</p>

    <p>11. And He did not lay His hand (yad - "hand") on the chief men (echad - "chief men") of the people (am - "people") of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God"); they beheld God (Elohim - "God"), and ate (akal - "ate") and drank (shatah - "drank").</p>

    <p>12. The LORD (YHWH - "the LORD") said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain (har - "mountain") and wait (yashav - "wait") there, that I may give you the tablets (luhot - "tablets") of stone (even - "stone"), with the law (torah - "instruction") and the commandment (mitzvah - "commandment"), which I have written for their instruction (lehorotam - "for their teaching").”</p>

    <p>13. So Moses rose with his assistant (mesharet - "servant") Joshua (Yehoshua - "YHWH is salvation") and Moses went up into the mountain (har - "mountain") of God (Elohim - "God").</p>

    <p>14. And he said to the elders (zekenim - "elders"), “Wait (yashav - "wait") here for us until we return to you. And behold (hineh - "behold"), Aaron and Hur (Chur - "free man") are with you. Whoever has a dispute (riv - "dispute") let him go to them.”</p>

    <p>15. Then Moses went up on the mountain (har - "mountain"), and the cloud (ananeh - "cloud") covered the mountain (har - "mountain").</p>

    <p>16. The glory (kabod - "glory") of the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD") dwelt on Mount Sinai (Har Sinai - "Mount Sinai"), and the cloud (ananeh - "cloud") covered it six days (yom - "days"). And on the seventh day (yom - "day") He called to Moses out of the midst (toch - "midst") of the cloud (ananeh - "cloud").</p>

    <p>17. Now the appearance (mareh - "appearance") of the glory (kabod - "glory") of the LORD (YHWH - "the LORD") was like a devouring fire (esh - "fire") on the top of the mountain (har - "mountain") in the sight (neged - "sight") of the people (am - "people") of Israel (Yisra'el - "he who struggles with God").</p>

    <p>18. Moses entered the cloud (ananeh - "cloud") and went up on the mountain (har - "mountain"). And Moses (Mosheh - "Drawn out") was on the mountain (har - "mountain") forty (arba'im - "forty") days (yom - "days") and forty (arba'im - "forty") nights (laylah - "nights").</p>
