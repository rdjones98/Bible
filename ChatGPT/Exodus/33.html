    <h1>Exodus 33</h1>
    <p><strong>1.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He is) said to Moses, “Go, go up from here, you and the people whom you brought up from the land of Egypt (Distress), to the land which I swore to Abraham (Father of a Multitude), to Isaac (He Laughs), and to Jacob (Heel Holder), saying, ‘To your seed I will give it.’</p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> And I will send before you an angel (Malach), and I will drive out the Canaanite (Lowland Dweller), the Amorite (Talker), and the Hittite (Fearsome), and the Perizzite (Villager), the Hivite (Tent Dweller), and the Jebusite (Threshing Floor Dweller),</p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> To a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go up in your midst, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you on the way.”</p>
    <p><strong>4.</strong> And the people heard this evil word, and they mourned, and no one put his ornaments on him.</p>
    <p><strong>5.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He is) said to Moses, “Say to the sons of Israel (God Strives), ‘You are a stiff-necked people; in one moment I would go up in your midst and consume you. And now, take down your ornaments from you, and I will know what I will do to you.’”</p>
    <p><strong>6.</strong> And the sons of Israel (God Strives) stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb (Desert). </p>
  <h2>The Tent of Meeting</h2>
  <p><strong>7.</strong> And Moses took the tent and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and he called it the Tent of Meeting. And it was that everyone seeking the Lord (YHWH - He is) would go out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp.</p>
    <p><strong>8.</strong> And it was, when Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise, and each man stood at the entrance of his tent and looked after Moses until he entered the tent.</p>
    <p><strong>9.</strong> And it was, as Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the entrance of the tent, and He spoke with Moses.</p>
    <p><strong>10.</strong> And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, and all the people rose and bowed, each man at the entrance of his tent.</p>
    <p><strong>11.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He is) spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he returned to the camp, but his servant Joshua (YHWH is Salvation), the son of Nun (Perpetuity), a young man, did not depart from within the tent.</p>
<h2>The Glory of the Lord</h2>
    <p><strong>12.</strong> And Moses said to the Lord (YHWH - He is), “See, You are saying to me, ‘Bring up this people,’ but You have not let me know whom You will send with me. And You have said, ‘I have known you by name, and you have also found favor in My eyes.’”</p>
    <p><strong>13.</strong> “And now, if I have found favor in Your eyes, please let me know Your ways, and I will know You, so that I may find favor in Your eyes. And see that this nation is Your people.”</p>
    <p><strong>14.</strong> And He said, “My presence will go, and I will give you rest.”</p>
    <p><strong>15.</strong> And he said to Him, “If Your presence does not go, do not bring us up from here.”</p>
    <p><strong>16.</strong> “And by what will it be known that I have found favor in Your eyes, I and Your people? Is it not in Your going with us? And we shall be distinguished, I and Your people, from all the people who are on the face of the ground.”</p>
    <p><strong>17.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He is) said to Moses, “This thing also that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favor in My eyes, and I have known you by name.”</p>
    <p><strong>18.</strong> And he said, “Please show me Your glory.”</p>
    <p><strong>19.</strong> And He said, “I will cause all My goodness to pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord (YHWH - He is) before you. And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.”</p>
    <p><strong>20.</strong> But He said, “You are not able to see My face, for no man shall see Me and live.”</p>
    <p><strong>21.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He is) said, “Behold, there is a place with Me, and you shall stand on the rock.”</p>
    <p><strong>22.</strong> “And it will be, when My glory passes over, that I will place you in the cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with My hand until I have passed over.”</p>
    <p><strong>23.</strong> “And I will take away My hand, and you shall see My back, but My face shall not be seen.”</p>
