    <h1>Exodus 21 - Literal Translation</h1>
    <p>1. "Now these are the rules that you shall set before them:</p>

    <p>2. When you buy a Hebrew slave (ebed - "servant"), he shall serve six years. And in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing.</p>

    <p>3. If he comes in single, he shall go out single. If he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him.</p>

    <p>4. If his master gives him a wife, and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out alone.</p>

    <p>5. But if the slave plainly says, 'I love my master (adonai - "my lord"), my wife (ishah - "woman") and my children (ben - "son," bat - "daughter"), I will not go out free,'</p>

    <p>6. then his master shall bring him to God (Elohim - "God"), and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave (ebed - "servant") forever.</p>

    <p>7. When a man (ish - "man") sells his daughter (bat - "daughter") as a slave (amah - "female servant"), she shall not go out as the male slaves (ebed - "servants") do.</p>

    <p>8. If she does not please her master (adonai - "my lord"), who has designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has broken faith with her.</p>

    <p>9. If he designates her for his son (ben - "son"), he shall deal with her as with a daughter (bat - "daughter").</p>

    <p>10. If he takes another wife (ishah - "woman"), he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights.</p>

    <p>11. And if he does not do these three things for her, she shall go out for nothing, without payment of money.</p>

    <p>12. Whoever strikes a man (ish - "man") so that he dies shall be put to death.</p>

    <p>13. But if he did not lie in wait for him, but God (Elohim - "God") let him fall into his hand, then I will appoint for you a place to which he may flee.</p>

    <p>14. But if a man (ish - "man") willfully attacks another to kill him by cunning, you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.</p>

    <p>15. Whoever kidnaps a man (ish - "man") and sells him, and anyone found in possession of him, shall be put to death.</p>

    <p>16. Whoever strikes his father (av - "father") or his mother (imah - "mother") shall be put to death.</p>

    <p>17. Whoever steals a man (ish - "man") and sells him, and anyone found in possession of him, shall be put to death.</p>

    <p>18. When men (ish - "men") quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist, and the man (ish - "man") does not die but takes to his bed,</p>

    <p>19. then if the man (ish - "man") rises again and walks outdoors with his staff, he who struck him shall be clear; only he shall pay for his loss of time, and shall have him thoroughly healed.</p>

    <p>20. When a man (ish - "man") strikes his slave (ebed - "servant") or his female slave (amah - "female servant"), with a rod, and the slave dies under his hand, he shall be avenged.</p>

    <p>21. But if the slave survives a day or two, he is not to be avenged, for the slave is his money.</p>

    <p>22. When men (ish - "men") strive together and hit a pregnant woman (ishah - "woman") so that her children come out, but there is no harm, the one who hit her shall surely be fined, as the woman's husband (ish - "man") shall impose on him, and he shall pay as the judges determine.</p>

    <p>23. But if there is harm, then you shall pay life for life,</p>

    <p>24. eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</p>

    <p>25. burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.</p>

    <p>26. When a man (ish - "man") strikes the eye of his slave (ebed - "servant") or the eye of his female slave (amah - "female servant"), and destroys it, he shall let him go free because of his eye.</p>

    <p>27. If he knocks out the tooth of his slave (ebed - "servant") or the tooth of his female slave (amah - "female servant"), he shall let him go free because of his tooth.</p>

    <p>28. When an ox (shor - "ox") gores a man (ish - "man") or a woman (ishah - "woman") to death, the ox (shor - "ox") shall surely be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten. But the owner of the ox (shor - "ox") shall be clear.</p>

    <p>29. But if the ox (shor - "ox") has been accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has been warned but has not kept it in, and it kills a man (ish - "man") or a woman (ishah - "woman"), the ox (shor - "ox") shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.</p>

    <p>30. If a ransom is imposed on him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is imposed on him.</p>

    <p>31. If it gores a son (ben - "son") or a daughter (bat - "daughter"), it shall be done to him according to this rule.</p>

    <p>32. If the ox (shor - "ox") gores a male or female servant (ebed - "servant," amah - "female servant"), the owner shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox (shor - "ox") shall be stoned.</p>

    <p>33. When a man (ish - "man") opens a pit, or when a man (ish - "man") digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox (shor - "ox") or a donkey (chamor - "donkey") falls into it,</p>

    <p>34. the owner of the pit shall make restitution. He shall give money to its owner, and the dead beast (chayah - "animal") shall be his.</p>

    <p>35. When one man's (ish - "man") ox (shor - "ox") hurts another's ox (shor - "ox"), so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox (shor - "ox") and divide its price. And the dead ox (shor - "ox") they shall also divide.</p>

    <p>36. Or if it is known that the ox (shor - "ox") has been accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has not kept it in, he shall pay ox (shor - "ox") for ox (shor - "ox"), and the dead beast (chayah - "animal") shall be his.</p>
