    <h1>Exodus 3</h1>

    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    Now Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) was taking care of the flock of Jethro (Yitro - his excellence), his father-in-law, the priest of Midian (Midyan - strife). He led the flock to the far side (Achar - back) of the desert (Midbar - wilderness) and came to the mountain (Har - mountain) of God (Elohim - Mighty Ones), to Horeb (Chorev - desolation).</p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    The <a href="../Commentary/angelofgod.html">angel (Mal'akh - angel) of the the Lord (YHWH - He is)</a> appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. Moses looked, and saw that the bush was burning with fire, but it was not being consumed.</p>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    Moses said, "I will turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burned up."</p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    When the Lord saw that Moses had turned aside to look, God called him from the midst of the bush, and said, "Moses, Moses!" And Moses answered, "Here I am (Hineni - here I am)."</p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    God said, "Do not come any closer. Take off your sandals because the place where you are standing is holy ground."</p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    He continued, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham (Avraham - father of many), the God of Isaac (Yitzhak - laughter), and the God of Jacob (Yaakov - supplanted)." Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.</p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    The Lord said, "I have certainly seen the suffering of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I know their pain,</p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    and I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites (Kena'ani - Canaanites), Hittites (Chitti - Hittites), Amorites (Emori - Amorites), Perizzites (Perizi - Perizzites), Hivites (Chivvi - Hivites), and Jebusites (Yevusi - Jebusites)."</p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    "Now, the cry of the Israelites (Bnei - sons of Israel) has reached me, and I have also seen the oppression (Latsar - oppression) that the Egyptians are causing them."</p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    "So now, go, I am sending you to Pharaoh, to bring my people, the Israelites (Bnei - sons of Israel), out of Egypt."</p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    But Moses said to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites (Bnei - sons of Israel) out of Egypt?"</p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    God said, "I will certainly be with you, and this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain (Har - mountain)."</p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    Moses said to God, "Suppose I go to the Israelites (Bnei - sons of Israel) and say to them, 'The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' What should I tell them?"</p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM (Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh - I AM WHO I AM). This is what you are to say to the Israelites (Bnei - sons of Israel): 'I AM has sent me to you.'"</p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    God also said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites (Bnei - sons of Israel), 'The Lord, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham (Avraham - father of many), the God of Isaac (Yitzhak - laughter), and the God of Jacob (Yaakov - supplanted), has sent me to you.' This is my name forever (Olam - forever), the name you shall use for all generations (Dor - generations)."</p>

    <p><strong>16. </strong>
    "Go, assemble the elders of Israel (Yisrael - God prevails) and say to them, 'The Lord, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham (Avraham - father of many), Isaac (Yitzhak - laughter), and Jacob (Yaakov - supplanted), has appeared to me and said, "I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt."'</p>

    <p><strong>17. </strong>
    "And I have promised to bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites (Kena'ani - Canaanites), Hittites (Chitti - Hittites), Amorites (Emori - Amorites), Perizzites (Perizi - Perizzites), Hivites (Chivvi - Hivites), and Jebusites (Yevusi - Jebusites), a land flowing with milk and honey."</p>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    "The elders of Israel will listen to you, then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Please let us go three days' journey (Derech - way) into the wilderness (Midbar - wilderness) to offer sacrifices (Zabach - sacrifice) to the Lord our God.'</p>
