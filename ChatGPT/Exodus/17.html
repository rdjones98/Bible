    <h1>Exodus 17</h1>
    <p>1. And all the congregation of the children of Israel (Yisra'el - "He struggles with God") journeyed from the wilderness of Sin (Sin - "thorn") by their journeys, according to the command of the LORD (YHWH - "I AM") and camped in Rephidim (Rephidim - "places of rest"), and there was no water for the people to drink.</p>

    <p>2. And the people quarreled with Moses (Mosheh - "drawn out") and said, "Give us water that we may drink." And Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD (YHWH - "I AM")?"</p>

    <p>3. But the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, "Why did you bring us up from Egypt to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?"</p>

    <p>4. So Moses cried to the LORD (YHWH - "I AM"), saying, "What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me."</p>

    <p>5. And the LORD (YHWH - "I AM") said to Moses, "Pass on before the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel (Yisra'el - "He struggles with God") and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile (Yor - "river"), and go.</p>

    <p>6. Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb (Horeb - "desolation"), and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people will drink." And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel (Yisra'el - "He struggles with God").</p>

    <p>7. And he called the name of the place Massah (Massah - "testing") and Meribah (Meribah - "quarreling"), because of the quarreling of the people of Israel (Yisra'el - "He struggles with God") and because they tested the LORD (YHWH - "I AM"), saying, "Is the LORD (YHWH - "I AM") among us or not?"</p>

    <p>8. Then Amalek (Amalek - "people of the valley") came and fought with Israel (Yisra'el - "He struggles with God") at Rephidim (Rephidim - "places of rest").</p>

    <p>9. So Moses said to Joshua (Yehoshua - "YHWH is salvation"), "Choose for us men and go out and fight with Amalek (Amalek - "people of the valley"). Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God (Elohim - "God") in my hand."</p>

    <p>10. So Joshua (Yehoshua - "YHWH is salvation") did as Moses (Mosheh - "drawn out") told him, and fought with Amalek (Amalek - "people of the valley"), while Moses, Aaron (Aharon - "high mountain" or "exalted"), and Hur (Hur - "white" or "free") went up to the top of the hill.</p>

    <p>11. Whenever Moses (Mosheh - "drawn out") held up his hand, Israel (Yisra'el - "He struggles with God") prevailed, and whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek (Amalek - "people of the valley") prevailed.</p>

    <p>12. But Moses' (Mosheh - "drawn out") hands grew weary, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it, while Aaron (Aharon - "high mountain" or "exalted") and Hur (Hur - "white" or "free") held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side. So his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</p>

    <p>13. And Joshua (Yehoshua - "YHWH is salvation") overwhelmed Amalek (Amalek - "people of the valley") and his people with the sword.</p>

    <p>14. Then the LORD (YHWH - "I AM") said to Moses (Mosheh - "drawn out"), "Write this as a memorial in a book and recite it in the ears of Joshua (Yehoshua - "YHWH is salvation"), that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek (Amalek - "people of the valley") from under heaven."</p>

    <p>15. And Moses (Mosheh - "drawn out") built an altar and called the name of it, "The LORD is my banner" (YHWH-Nissi - "The LORD is my banner").</p>

    <p>16. Saying, "A hand upon the throne of the LORD (YHWH - "I AM"), the LORD (YHWH - "I AM") will have war with Amalek (Amalek - "people of the valley") from generation to generation."</p>
