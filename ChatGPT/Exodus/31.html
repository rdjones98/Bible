    <h1>Exodus 31 - Literal Translation</h1>

    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    And the LORD (YHWH - I AM) spake unto Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), saying,</p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    See, I have called by name Bezalel (Betzalel - in the shadow of God) the son of Uri (Uri - my light), the son of Hur (Hur - white, pure), of the tribe of Judah (Yehudah - praised):</p>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    And I have filled him with the spirit of God (Elohim - God), in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,</p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    To devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,</p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.</p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab (Oholiav - my tent is God), the son of Ahisamach (Achisamakh - brother of support), of the tribe of Dan (Dan - judge): and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;</p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,</p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,</p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,</p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    And the clothes of service, and the holy garments for Aaron (Aharon - exalted) the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,</p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.</p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    And the LORD (YHWH - I AM) spake unto Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), saying,</p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    Speak thou also unto the children of Israel (Yisrael - He who struggles with God), saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD (YHWH - I AM) that doth sanctify you.</p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD (YHWH - I AM): whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.</p>

    <p><strong>16. </strong>
    Wherefore the children of Israel (Yisrael - He who struggles with God) shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.</p>

    <p><strong>17. </strong>
    It is a sign between me and the children of Israel (Yisrael - He who struggles with God) forever: for in six days the LORD (YHWH - I AM) made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.</p>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    And he gave unto Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai (Sinai - thorny), two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God (Elohim - God).</p>
