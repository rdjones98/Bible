    <h1>Exodus 34</h1>
	<h2>The New Stone Tablets</h2>
    <p><strong>1.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He is) said to Moses, “Carve for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I will write upon the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.</p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> And be ready in the morning, and go up in the morning to Mount Sinai (Thorny), and stand there for Me on the top of the mountain.</p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> And no man shall go up with you, and also no man shall be seen on all the mountain; also the flock and the cattle shall not graze before that mountain.”</p>
    <p><strong>4.</strong> And he carved two tablets of stone like the first ones, and Moses rose early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai (Thorny), as the Lord (YHWH - He is) had commanded him, and he took in his hand the two tablets of stone.</p>
    <p><strong>5.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He is) descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and He called upon the name of the Lord (YHWH - He is).</p>
    <p><strong>6.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He is) passed before his face and proclaimed, “the Lord (YHWH - He is), the Lord (YHWH - He is), God (El) merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving-kindness and truth,</p>
    <p><strong>7.</strong> Keeping loving-kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons and upon the sons of the sons, to the third and fourth generation.”</p>
    <p><strong>8.</strong> And Moses hurried and bowed to the ground and prostrated himself.</p>
    <p><strong>9.</strong> And he said, “If now I have found favor in Your eyes, O Lord (Adonai), let my Lord (Adonai) please go in our midst, for it is a stiff-necked people. And forgive our iniquity and our sin, and take us as Your inheritance.”</p>
    <p><strong>10.</strong> And He said, “Behold, I am making a covenant; before all your people I will do wonders that have not been created in all the earth nor among all the nations. And all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the Lord (YHWH - He is), for it is an awesome thing that I am doing with you.”</p>
    <p><strong>11.</strong> “Observe what I command you this day. Behold, I am driving out from before you the Amorite (Talker), and the Canaanite (Lowland Dweller), and the Hittite (Fearsome), and the Perizzite (Villager), and the Hivite (Tent Dweller), and the Jebusite (Threshing Floor Dweller).”</p>
    <p><strong>12.</strong> “Guard yourself lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going, lest it become a snare in your midst.”</p>
    <p><strong>13.</strong> “But you shall tear down their altars, and break their pillars, and cut down their Asherah (Sacred Tree) poles.”</p>
    <p><strong>14.</strong> “For you shall not bow to another god (El), for the Lord (YHWH - He is), whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God (El).”</p>
    <p><strong>15.</strong> “Lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go whoring after their gods, and they sacrifice to their gods, and they invite you, and you eat of their sacrifice.”</p>
    <p><strong>16.</strong> “And you take from their daughters for your sons, and their daughters go whoring after their gods, and they make your sons go whoring after their gods.”</p>
    <p><strong>17.</strong> “You shall not make for yourself molten gods.”</p>
    <p><strong>18.</strong> “You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Aviv (Spring), for in the month of Aviv (Spring) you came out from Egypt (Distress).”</p>
    <p><strong>19.</strong> “Every firstborn of the womb is Mine, and all your male livestock, the firstborn of ox and sheep.”</p>
    <p><strong>20.</strong> “And the firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. Every firstborn of your sons you shall redeem, and none shall appear before Me empty-handed.”</p>
    <p><strong>21.</strong> “Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.”</p>
    <p><strong>22.</strong> “And you shall observe the Feast of Weeks, the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.”</p>
    <p><strong>23.</strong> “Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord (Adonai) the Lord (YHWH - He is), the God (Elohim) of Israel (God Strives).”</p>
    <p><strong>24.</strong> “For I will dispossess nations before you and enlarge your borders, and no man shall covet your land when you go up to appear before the Lord (YHWH - He is) your God (Elohim) three times in the year.”</p>
    <p><strong>25.</strong> “You shall not slaughter the blood of My sacrifice with leaven, and the sacrifice of the Feast of Passover shall not remain until morning.”</p>
    <p><strong>26.</strong> “The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring to the house of the Lord (YHWH - He is) your God (Elohim). You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.”</p>
    <p><strong>27.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He is) said to Moses, “Write for yourself these words, for upon the mouth of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel (God Strives).”</p>
    <p><strong>28.</strong> And he was there with the Lord (YHWH - He is) forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread, and he did not drink water, and He wrote upon the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Words.</p>
	<h2>The Radiant Face of Moses</h2>
    <p><strong>29.</strong> And it was, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai (Thorny), with the two tablets of the Testimony in Moses' (Drawn Out) hand as he came down from the mountain, that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because He had spoken with him.</p>
    <p><strong>30.</strong> And Aaron (Light Bringer) and all the sons of Israel (God Strives) saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to approach him.</p>
