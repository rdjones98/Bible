    <h1>Exodus 23 - Literal Translation</h1>
    <p>1. You shall not spread a false report. You shall not join hands with the wicked (rasha - "wicked") to be a malicious witness (ed - "witness").</p>

    <p>2. You shall not fall in with the many to do evil (ra'ah - "evil"), nor shall you bear witness (ed - "witness") in a lawsuit (mishpat - "judgment") siding with the many so as to pervert justice (tsedeq - "justice").</p>

    <p>3. Nor shall you be partial to a poor (dal - "poor") man (ish - "man") in his lawsuit (mishpat - "judgment").</p>

    <p>4. If you meet your enemy's (oyev - "enemy") ox (shor - "ox") or his donkey (chamor - "donkey") going astray, you shall bring it back to him.</p>

    <p>5. If you see the donkey (chamor - "donkey") of one who hates you lying down under its burden, you shall refrain from leaving him with it; you shall surely release it with him.</p>

    <p>6. You shall not pervert the justice (mishpat - "judgment") due to your poor (dal - "poor") in his lawsuit (mishpat - "judgment").</p>

    <p>7. Keep far from a false charge (davar - "word") and do not kill the innocent (zakeh - "innocent") and righteous (tzaddik - "righteous"). For I will not acquit the wicked (rasha - "wicked").</p>

    <p>8. And you shall take no bribe (shochad - "bribe"), for a bribe (shochad - "bribe") blinds the clear-sighted (chakam - "wise") and subverts the cause of those who are in the right (tzaddik - "righteous").</p>

    <p>9. You shall not oppress (anah - "oppress") a sojourner (ger - "foreigner"). You know the heart (lev - "heart") of a sojourner (ger - "foreigner"), for you were sojourners (ger - "foreigners") in the land of Egypt (Mitsrayim - "the narrow places").</p>

    <p>10. For six years you shall sow your land (adamah - "land") and gather in its yield (tevu'ah - "produce"),</p>

    <p>11. but the seventh year you shall let it rest (shamat - "rest") and lie fallow (nashav - "abandoned"), that the poor (ani - "poor") of your people (am - "people") may eat, and what they leave the beasts (chayah - "animals") of the field (sadeh - "field") may eat. You shall do likewise with your vineyard (kerem - "vineyard") and with your olive orchard (zayit - "olive tree").</p>

    <p>12. Six days you shall do your work, but on the seventh day you shall rest (shabat - "rest"), that your ox (shor - "ox") and your donkey (chamor - "donkey") may have rest (nuah - "rest"), and the son of your servant (ebed - "servant") and the sojourner (ger - "foreigner") may be refreshed (naphash - "refreshed").</p>

    <p>13. Pay attention to all that I have said to you, and make no mention of the names (shem - "name") of other gods (el - "god"), nor let it be heard on your lips.</p>

    <p>14. Three times in the year (shanah - "year") you shall keep a feast (chag - "feast") to me.</p>

    <p>15. You shall keep the Feast (chag - "feast") of Unleavened Bread (matzah - "unleavened bread"). As I commanded you, you shall eat unleavened bread (matzah - "unleavened bread") for seven days at the appointed time (mo'ed - "appointed time") in the month (chodesh - "month") of Abib (Abib - "the month of spring"), for in it you came out of Egypt (Mitsrayim - "the narrow places"). None shall appear before me empty-handed.</p>

    <p>16. You shall keep the Feast (chag - "feast") of Harvest (katsir - "harvest"), of the first fruits (bikkurim - "first fruits") of your labor (ma'aseh - "work") of what you sow in the field (sadeh - "field"). You shall keep the Feast (chag - "feast") of Ingathering (asif - "ingathering") at the end of the year (shanah - "year"), when you gather in from the field (sadeh - "field") the fruit of your labor (ma'aseh - "work").</p>

    <p>17. Three times in the year (shanah - "year") shall all your males (zakhar - "male") appear before the Lord (Adonai - "Sovereign") God (Elohim - "God").</p>

    <p>18. You shall not offer the blood (dam - "blood") of my sacrifice (zevach - "sacrifice") with anything leavened (chametz - "leaven"), neither shall the fat (helev - "fat") of my feast (chag - "feast") remain until the morning.</p>

    <p>19. The best of the first fruits (bikkurim - "first fruits") of your ground (adamah - "land") you shall bring into the house (bayit - "house") of the Lord (Adonai - "Sovereign") your God (Elohim - "God"). You shall not boil a young goat (gedi - "young goat") in its mother's milk.</p>

    <p>20. Behold, I send an angel (malakh - "angel") before you to guard you on the way (derekh - "way") and to bring you to the place (maqom - "place") that I have prepared.</p>

    <p>21. Pay careful attention to him and obey his voice (qol - "voice"). Do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgression (pesha - "transgression"), for my name (shem - "name") is in him.</p>

    <p>22. But if you carefully obey his voice (qol - "voice") and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy (oyev - "enemy") to your enemies (oyev - "enemies") and an adversary (tsar - "adversary") to your adversaries (tsar - "adversaries").</p>

    <p>23. When my angel (malakh - "angel") goes before you and brings you to the Amorites (Emori - "Amorites"), and the Hittites (Chitti - "Hittites"), and the Perizzites (Perizzi - "Perizzites"), and the Canaanites (Kenaani - "Canaanites"), the Hivites (Chivvi - "Hivites"), and the Jebusites (Yevusi - "Jebusites"), and I blot them out,</p>

    <p>24. you shall not bow down to their gods (el - "gods") nor serve them, nor do as they do, but you shall utterly overthrow them and break their pillars (matzevah - "pillars") in pieces.</p>

    <p>25. You shall serve the Lord (Adonai - "Sovereign") your God (Elohim - "God"), and he will bless your bread (lechem - "bread") and your water (mayim - "water"), and I will take sickness (maka - "sickness") away from among you.</p>

    <p>26. None shall miscarry (shakal - "miscarry") or be barren (akar - "barren") in your land (adamah - "land"). I will fulfill the number of your days (yom - "days").</p>

    <p>27. I will send my terror (pahad - "terror") before you and will throw into confusion all the people (am - "people") against whom you shall come, and I will make all your enemies (oyev - "enemies") turn their backs to you.</p>

    <p>28. And I will send hornets (tsir'ah - "hornets") before you, which shall drive out the Hivites (Chivvi - "Hivites"), the Canaanites (Kenaani - "Canaanites"), and the Hittites (Chitti - "Hittites") from before you.</p>

    <p>29. I will not drive them out from before you in one year (shanah - "year"), lest the land (adamah - "land") become desolate (shamem - "desolate") and the wild beasts (chayah - "beasts") multiply against you.</p>

    <p>30. Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you have increased (yarbah - "increased") and possess the land (adamah - "land").</p>

    <p>31. And I will set your border (gebul - "border") from the Red Sea (Yam Suf - "Red Sea") to the sea of the Philistines (Yam Plishtim - "Philistine Sea"), and from the wilderness (midbar - "wilderness") to the Euphrates (Perat - "Euphrates"). For I will give the inhabitants (yoshvei - "inhabitants") of the land (adamah - "land") into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you.</p>

    <p>32. You shall make no covenant (berit - "covenant") with them or with their gods (el - "gods").</p>

    <p>33. They shall not dwell in your land (adamah - "land"), lest they make you sin against me. For if you serve their gods (el - "gods"), it will surely be a snare (moqesh - "snare") to you.</p>
