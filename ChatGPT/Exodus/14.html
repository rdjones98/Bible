    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    When the king (Melek - king) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt) was told (Nagad - told) that the people (Am - people) had fled (Nasa - fled), the mind (Lev - heart) of Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) and his servants (Avad - servants) was changed (Chazar - changed) toward the people (Am - people), and they said (Amar - said), "What is this we have done (Asah - done), that we have let (Shalach - let) Israel (Yisra'el - Israel) go (Halak - go) from serving (Avad - serving) us?" </p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    So he made ready (Chazaq - made ready) his chariot (Rekhev - chariot) and took (Lakah - took) his army (Tzavah - army) with him. </p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    The Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians) pursued (Radaph - pursued) them, all the horses (Sus - horses) and chariots (Rekhev - chariots) of Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh), and his horsemen (Parash - horsemen) and his army (Tzavah - army), and overtook (Asaf - overtook) them encamped (Chanah - encamped) at the sea (Yam - sea) by Pi-hahiroth (Pi Hachiroth - Pi-hahiroth), in front of Baal-zephon (Baal-Tsefon - Baal-zephon). </p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    They said (Amar - said) to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "Is it because there are no graves (Qever - graves) in Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt) that you have taken us away (Lakach - taken us away) to die (Muth - die) in the wilderness (Midbar - wilderness)? What have you done (Asah - done) to us in bringing us out (Yatsa - bringing us out) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt)? </p>

    Is not this what we said (Amar - said) to you in Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt), 'Leave us alone (Azav - leave us alone) that we may serve (Avad - serve) the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians)'?

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    And Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) said (Amar - said) to the people (Am - people), "Fear (Yare - fear) not, stand firm (Yatsab - stand firm), and see (Ra'ah - see) the salvation (Yeshua - salvation) of the Lord (YHWH - He is), which he will work (Asah - work) for you today (Yom - day).

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    The Lord (YHWH - He is) will fight (Lacham - fight) for you, and you have only (Rak - only) to be silent (Chashah - silent)." </p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    The Lord (YHWH - He is) said (Amar - said) to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "Why do you cry (Tza'aq - cry) to me? Tell (Dabar - tell) the people (Am - people) of Israel (Yisra'el - Israel) to go forward (Nasa - go forward). </p>

    <p><strong>16. </strong>
    Lift up (Nasa - lift up) your staff (Mateh - staff), and stretch out (Natah - stretch out) your hand (Yad - hand) over the sea (Yam - sea), and divide (Baqa - divide) it, that the people (Am - people) of Israel (Yisra'el - Israel) may go through (Avar - go through) the sea (Yam - sea) on dry ground (Yabashah - dry ground). </p>

    <p><strong>17. </strong>
    And I will harden (Chazaq - harden) the hearts (Lev - hearts) of the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians), so that they shall go in (Bo - go in) after them, and I will get glory (Kavod - glory) over Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) and all his army (Tzavah - army), his chariots (Rekhev - chariots), and his horsemen (Parash - horsemen). </p>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    And the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians) shall know (Yada - know) that I am the Lord (YHWH - He is), when I have gotten glory (Kavod - glory) over Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh), his chariots (Rekhev - chariots), and his horsemen (Parash - horsemen)." </p>

    <p><strong>19. </strong>
    Then the angel (Malak - angel) of God (Elohim - God) who was going (Halak - going) before the host (Machaneh - host) of Israel (Yisra'el - Israel) moved and went behind them, and the pillar (Amud - pillar) of cloud (Anan - cloud) moved from before them and stood (Amad - stood) behind them, </p>

    <p><strong>20. </strong>
    coming between (Badal - between) the camp (Machaneh - camp) of the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians) and the camp (Machaneh - camp) of Israel (Yisra'el - Israel). And there was the cloud (Anan - cloud) and the darkness (Choshekh - darkness), and it lit up (Awr - lit up) the night (Lailah - night) without one coming near (Nagash - near) the other all night (Lailah - night). </p>

    <p><strong>21. </strong>
    Then Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) stretched out (Natah - stretched out) his hand (Yad - hand) over the sea (Yam - sea), and the Lord (YHWH - He is) drove the sea (Yam - sea) back by a strong (Chazaq - strong) east wind (Ruach - wind) all night (Lailah - night) and made the sea (Yam - sea) dry land (Yabashah - dry land), and the waters (Mayim - waters) were divided (Baqa - divided). </p>

    <p><strong>22. </strong>
    And the people (Am - people) of Israel (Yisra'el - Israel) went into the midst (Tavek - midst) of the sea (Yam - sea) on dry ground (Yabashah - dry ground), the waters (Mayim - waters) being a wall (Chomah - wall) to them on their right hand (Yad - hand) and on their left hand (Yad - hand). </p>

    <p><strong>23. </strong>
    The Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians) pursued (Radaph - pursued) and went in (Bo - went in) after them into the midst (Tavek - midst) of the sea (Yam - sea), all Pharaoh's (Par'oh - Pharaoh's) horses (Sus - horses), his chariots (Rekhev - chariots), and his horsemen (Parash - horsemen). </p>

    <p><strong>24. </strong>
    And in the morning watch (Boker - watch), the Lord (YHWH - He is) looked down (Nabat - looked down) on the Egyptian army (Tzavah - army) through the pillar (Amud - pillar) of fire (Esh - fire) and cloud (Anan - cloud), and threw (Hurl - threw) the Egyptian army (Tzavah - army) into a panic (Balah - panic). </p>

    <p><strong>25. </strong>
    He clogged (Kashal - clogged) their chariot wheels (Rekhev - wheels) so that they drove heavily (Kashal - heavily), and the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians) said (Amar - said), "Let us flee (Nasut - flee) from before (Mipney - before) Israel (Yisra'el - Israel), for the Lord (YHWH - He is) fights (Lacham - fights) for them against the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians)." </p>

    <p><strong>26. </strong>
    Then the Lord (YHWH - He is) said (Amar - said) to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "Stretch out (Natah - stretch out) your hand (Yad - hand) over the sea (Yam - sea), that the waters (Mayim - waters) may come back (Shub - come back) upon the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians), upon their chariots (Rekhev - chariots), and upon their horsemen (Parash - horsemen)." </p>

    <p><strong>27. </strong>
    So Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) stretched out (Natah - stretched out) his hand (Yad - hand) over the sea (Yam - sea), and the sea (Yam - sea) returned (Shub - returned) to its normal course (Tav - course) when the morning appeared (Boker - appeared). And as the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians) fled into it (Boa - fled), the Lord (YHWH - He is) threw (Hurl - threw) the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians) into the midst (Tavek - midst) of the sea (Yam - sea). </p>

    <p><strong>28. </strong>
    The waters (Mayim - waters) returned (Shub - returned) and covered (Kasal - covered) the chariots (Rekhev - chariots) and the horsemen (Parash - horsemen). Of all the host (Machaneh - host) of Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) that had followed them into the sea (Yam - sea), not one of them remained (Sha'ar - remained). </p>

    <p><strong>29. </strong>
    But the people (Am - people) of Israel (Yisra'el - Israel) walked on dry ground (Yabashah - dry ground) through the sea (Yam - sea), the waters (Mayim - waters) being a wall (Chomah - wall) to them on their right hand (Yad - hand) and on their left hand (Yad - hand). </p>

    <p><strong>30. </strong>
    Thus the Lord (YHWH - He is) saved (Yasha - saved) Israel (Yisra'el - Israel) that day (Yom - day) from the hand (Yad - hand) of the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians), and Israel (Yisra'el - Israel) saw (Ra'ah - saw) the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians) dead (Muth - dead) on the seashore (Yam - shore). </p>

    <p><strong>31. </strong>
    Israel (Yisra'el - Israel) saw (Ra'ah - saw) the great (Gadol - great) power (Yad - power) that the Lord (YHWH - He is) used (Asah - used) against the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egyptians), so the people (Am - people) feared (Yare - feared) the Lord (YHWH - He is), and they believed (Aman - believed) in the Lord (YHWH - He is) and in his servant (Eved - servant) Moses (Mosheh - drawn out). </p>
