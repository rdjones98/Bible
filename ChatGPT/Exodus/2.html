    Now a man (Ish - man) of the house (Bait - house) of Levi (Levi - joined) went and took (Lakah - took) as his wife (Isha - wife) a daughter (Bat - daughter) of Levi (Levi - joined).</p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    The woman (Isha - woman) conceived (Harah - conceived) and gave birth (Yalad - gave birth) to a son (Ben - son). When she saw that he was a fine child (Tov - good), she hid him for three months (Shalosh - three months).</p>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    But when she could hide him no longer, she took for him a basket (Tevat - basket) of bulrushes (Gomeh - papyrus), and coated it with tar (Chomer - pitch) and with pitch (Zefet - pitch). She placed the child (Yeled - child) in it and laid it among the reeds (Suf - reeds) by the bank (Saf - edge) of the Nile (Yor - river).</p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    His sister (Achot - sister) stood at a distance (Rechok - distance), to see what would be done (Asah - done) to him.</p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>

She saw the basket (Tevat - basket) among the reeds (Suf - reeds), and sent her servant (Amat - maidservant) to get it.</p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    When she opened it, she saw the child (Yeled - child), and behold, the baby (Taph - infant) was crying (Bachah - crying). She had pity (Racham - compassion) on him and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' (Ivrim - Hebrews) children (Yeled - children)." </p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    Then his sister (Achot - sister) said to Pharaoh's (Par'oh - Pharaoh's) daughter (Bat - daughter), "Shall I go and call a nurse (Me'eneket - nurse) for you from the Hebrew (Ivrim - Hebrews) women (Nashim - women), that she may nurse (Yenik - nurse) the child (Yeled - child) for you?"</p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    Pharaoh's (Par'oh - Pharaoh's) daughter (Bat - daughter) said to her, "Go." So the girl (Na'arah - girl) went and called the child's (Yeled - child) mother (Em - mother).</p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    Pharaoh's (Par'oh - Pharaoh's) daughter (Bat - daughter) said to her, "Take this child (Yeled - child) away and nurse (Yenik - nurse) him for me, and I will pay you (Shalam - pay). So the woman (Isha - woman) took the child (Yeled - child) and nursed (Yenik - nursed) him.</p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    He looked around (Savar - looked) and saw that there was no one (Ish - man) around, so he struck (Nakah - struck) the Egyptian (Mitzri - Egyptian) and hid (Nasan - hid) him in the sand (Chol - sand).</p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    When he went out (Yatza - went out) the next day, behold, two Hebrews (Ivrim - Hebrews) were fighting (Natsah - fighting). He said to the one who did the wrong (Rasha - wrong), "Why are you striking (Nakah - striking) your companion (Re'a - fellow)?"</p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    When Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) heard (Shama - heard) of this matter (Dabar - matter), he sought (Baqash - sought) to kill (Harag - kill) Moses (Mosheh - drawn out).

    He said to his daughters (Bat - daughters), "Where is he? Why have you left (Azab - left) the man (Ish - man)? Call (Qara - call) him, that he may eat (Akal - eat) bread (Lechem - bread)."</p>

    <p><strong>21. </strong>
