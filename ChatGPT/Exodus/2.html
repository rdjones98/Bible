    <h1>Exodus 2</h1>

    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    Now a man of the house of Levi (Levi - joined) went and took as his wife a daughter (Bat - daughter) of Levi (Levi - joined).</p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    The woman conceived and gave birth to a son (Ben - son). When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.</p>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    But when she could hide him no longer, she took for him a basket of bulrushes, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She placed the child in it and laid it among the reeds by the bank (Saf - edge) of the Nile.</p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    His sister stood at a distance, to see what would be done to him.</p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, and her maidens walked along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds, and sent her servant to get it.</p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. She had pity on him and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children." </p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?"</p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go." So the girl went and called the child's mother (Em - mother).</p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will pay you. So the woman took the child and nursed him.</p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    The child grew (Gadal - grew), and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), saying, "Because I drew him out of the water."</p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    In those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people.</p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    He looked around and saw that there was no one around, so he struck the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were fighting. He said to the one who did the wrong, "Why are you striking your companion?"</p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    The man said, "Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid, and thought, "Surely the matter is known."</p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled (Nadad - fled) from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian (Midyan - strife), and sat down by a well
    <p><strong>16. </strong>
    Now the priest of Midian (Midyan - strife) had seven daughters (Bat - daughters), and they came to draw water and filled the troughs (Ravah - troughs) to water their father's flock.</p>

    <p><strong>17. </strong>
    The shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock.</p>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    When they came to Reuel (R'uel - friend of God), their father, he said, "Why have you come back so soon today?"</p>

    <p><strong>19. </strong>
    They said, "An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water for us and watered the flock."</p>

    <p><strong>20. </strong>
    He said to his daughters, "Where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread."</p>

    <p><strong>21. </strong>
    Moses agreed to stay) with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah (Tzipporah - bird) as his wife.</p>

    <p><strong>22. </strong>
    She gave birth to a son, and he  his name Gershom (Gershom - a stranger there), for he said, "I have been a stranger in a foreign land."</p>

    <p><strong>23. </strong>
    After a long time the king of Egypt died, and the Israelites (Bnei - sons of Israel) groaned because of their slavery and cried out. Their cry for help (Shav - help) because of their slavery went up to God (Elohim - Mighty Ones).</p>

    <p><strong>24. </strong>
    God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) heard their groaning and remembered his covenant with Abraham (Avraham - father of many), with Isaac (Yitzhak - laughter), and with Jacob (Yaakov - supplanted).</p>

    <p><strong>25. </strong>
    God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) saw the Israelites (Bnei - sons of Israel) and knew about their suffering.</p>
