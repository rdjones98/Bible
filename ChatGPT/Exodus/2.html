    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    Now a man of the house of Levi (Levi - joined) went and took as his wife a daughter (Bat - daughter) of Levi (Levi - joined).</p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    The woman conceived (Harah - conceived) and gave birth to a son (Ben - son). When she saw that he was a fine child (Tov - good), she hid him for three months (Shalosh - three months).</p>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    But when she could hide him no longer, she took for him a basket of bulrushes (Gomeh - papyrus), and coated it with tar (Chomer - pitch) and with pitch (Zefet - pitch). She placed the child in it and laid it among the reeds (Suf - reeds) by the bank (Saf - edge) of the Nile.</p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    His sister stood at a distance, to see what would be done to him.</p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    The daughter (Bat - daughter) of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, and her maidens (Shifchah - maidens) walked along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds (Suf - reeds), and sent her servant (Amat - maidservant) to get it.</p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. She had pity (Racham - compassion) on him and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children (Yeled - children)." </p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter (Bat - daughter), "Shall I go and call a nurse (Me'eneket - nurse) for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?"</p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    Pharaoh's daughter (Bat - daughter) said to her, "Go." So the girl went and called the child's mother (Em - mother).</p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    Pharaoh's daughter (Bat - daughter) said to her, "Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will pay you (Shalam - pay). So the woman took the child and nursed (Yenik - nursed) him.</p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    The child grew (Gadal - grew), and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter (Bat - daughter), and he became her son (Ben - son). She named him Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), saying, "Because I drew him out (Mashah - drew out) of the water."</p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    In those days, when Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their hard labor (Sivlot - burdens). He saw an Egyptian (Mitzri - Egyptian) beating (Nakah - striking) a Hebrew, one of his people.</p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    He looked around and saw that there was no one around, so he struck the Egyptian (Mitzri - Egyptian) and hid (Nasan - hid) him in the sand (Chol - sand).</p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were fighting. He said to the one who did the wrong (Rasha - wrong), "Why are you striking (Nakah - striking) your companion (Re'a - fellow)?"</p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    The man said, "Who made you a prince (Sar - ruler) and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian (Mitzri - Egyptian)?" Then Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) was afraid (Yare - afraid), and thought (Chashav - thought), "Surely the matter (Dabar - matter) is known (Yadah - known)."</p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    When Pharaoh heard of this matter (Dabar - matter), he sought (Baqash - sought) to kill Moses (Mosheh - drawn out). But Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) fled (Nadad - fled) from Pharaoh and settled (Yashav - dwelt) in the land of Midian (Midyan - strife), and sat down (Yashav - sat) by a well (Be'er - well).</p>

    <p><strong>16. </strong>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    When they came to Reuel (R'uel - friend of God), their father (Av - father), he said, "Why have you come back (Bo - returned) so soon (Mahar - soon) today?"</p>

    <p><strong>19. </strong>

    <p><strong>20. </strong>
    He said to his daughters (Bat - daughters), "Where is he? Why have you left (Azab - left) the man? Call (Qara - call) him, that he may eat (Akal - eat) bread (Lechem - bread)."</p>

    <p><strong>21. </strong>
    Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) agreed to stay) with the man, and he gave Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) his daughter (Bat - daughter) Zipporah (Tzipporah - bird) as his wife.</p>

    <p><strong>22. </strong>
    She gave birth to a son (Ben - son), and he  his name Gershom (Gershom - a stranger there), for he said, "I have been a stranger (Ger - stranger) in a foreign land."</p>

    <p><strong>23. </strong>
