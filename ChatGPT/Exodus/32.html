<h1>Exodus 32: Literal Translation</h1>

<h2>The Golden Calf</h2>

<p>1 And when the people (am, meaning "the nation") saw that Moses (Moses, meaning "drawn out" or "saved from the water") delayed in coming down from the mountain, the people gathered together to Aaron (Aaron), and said to him, "Get up, make us gods to go before us; because this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt (Mitsrayim, meaning "the land of bondage"), we do not know what has become of him."</p>

<p>2 And Aaron (Aaron) said to them, "Break off the golden earrings that are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me."</p>

<p>3 And all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them to Aaron (Aaron).</p>

<p>4 And he took them from their hand, and made it into a molten calf; and they said, "These are your gods, O Israel (Yisrael, meaning "he who strives with God"), who brought you up out of the land of Egypt (Mitsrayim)."</p>

<p>5 And when Aaron (Aaron) saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron (Aaron) proclaimed, "Tomorrow is a feast for the LORD (YHWH)."</p>

<p>6 And they rose early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and drink, and then rose up to play.</p>

<h2>The LORD’s Anger and Moses’ Plea</h2>

<p>7 And the LORD (YHWH) said to Moses (Moses), "Go, descend, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt (Mitsrayim), have corrupted themselves:</p>

<p>8 they have quickly turned aside from the way I commanded them; they have made for themselves a molten calf and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, 'These are your gods, O Israel (Yisrael), who brought you up out of the land of Egypt (Mitsrayim).'</p>

<p>9 And the LORD (YHWH) said to Moses (Moses), "I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people:</p>

<p>10 now therefore leave me alone, so that my anger may burn hot against them and I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation."</p>

<p>11 And Moses (Moses) pleaded with the LORD (YHWH) his God (Elohim), and said, "LORD (YHWH), why does your anger burn hot against your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt (Mitsrayim) with great power and with a mighty hand?</p>

<p>12 Why should the Egyptians (Mitsrayim) say, 'With evil intent He brought them out, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth'? Turn from your fierce anger, and change your mind about the disaster that you have planned against your people.</p>

<p>13 Remember Abraham (Avraham), Isaac (Yitzhak), and Israel (Yisrael), your servants, to whom you swore by yourself and said to them, 'I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.'</p>

<p>14 And the LORD (YHWH) changed his mind about the disaster that He had spoken of bringing upon His people.</p>

<h2>Moses Intervenes for Israel</h2>

<p>15 Then Moses (Moses) turned and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand. The tablets were written on both sides; on the front and on the back they were written.</p>

<p>16 And the tablets were the work of God (Elohim), and the writing was the writing of God (Elohim), engraved on the tablets.</p>

<p>17 When Joshua (Yehoshua, meaning "salvation") heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses (Moses), "There is a sound of war in the camp."</p>

<p>18 But he said, "It is not the sound of victory, nor the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear."</p>

<p>19 And as soon as he came near the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. And Moses (Moses) became angry, and threw the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.</p>

<p>20 And he took the calf that they had made, burned it with fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on the water, and made the people of Israel (Yisrael) drink it.</p>

<h2>Moses Rebukes Aaron</h2>

<p>21 And Moses (Moses) said to Aaron (Aaron), "What did this people do to you, that you have brought such a great sin upon them?"</p>

<p>22 And Aaron (Aaron) said, "Do not let the anger of my lord burn hot. You know the people (am), that they are prone to evil.</p>

<p>23 For they said to me, 'Make us gods to go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt (Mitsrayim), we do not know what has become of him.'</p>

<p>24 And I said to them, 'Whoever has gold, let them break it off.' So they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."</p>

<h2>Moses Takes Action</h2>

<p>25 And when Moses (Moses) saw that the people were unrestrained (for Aaron (Aaron) had let them get out of control to the point of being a disgrace among their enemies),</p>

<p>26 Moses (Moses) stood at the entrance of the camp and said, "Whoever is for the LORD (YHWH), come to me!" And all the sons of Levi (Levi, meaning "joined") gathered themselves together to him.</p>

<p>27 And he said to them, "This is what the LORD (YHWH), the God (Elohim) of Israel (Yisrael), says: 'Put your sword on your side, each of you. Go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and kill every man his brother, every man his friend, and every man his neighbor.'</p>

<p>28 The sons of Levi (Levi) did as Moses (Moses) commanded, and about three thousand men of the people fell that day.</p>

<p>29 And Moses (Moses) said, "Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD (YHWH), for every one of you has been against his son and against his brother, so that He may bestow a blessing upon you today."</p>

<h2>Moses Returns to the LORD</h2>

<p>30 The next day Moses (Moses) said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin, but now I will go up to the LORD (YHWH); perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."</p>

<p>31 So Moses (Moses) returned to the LORD (YHWH) and said, "Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made for themselves gods of gold.</p>

<p>32 Yet now, if you will forgive their sin, well and good; but if not, wipe me out of your book that you have written."</p>

<p>33 But the LORD (YHWH) said to Moses (Moses), "Whoever has sinned against me, I will wipe him out of my book."</p>

<p>34 But now go, lead the people to the place I have spoken of; behold, my angel (malakh, meaning "messenger") shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them."</p>

<p>35 And the LORD (YHWH) plagued the people, because they made the calf, the one that Aaron (Aaron) made.</p>
