    <h1>Exodus 6</h1>

    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    But the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh. For with a strong hand he will send them out, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land." </p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    And God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) spoke to Moses and said to him, "I am the Lord. </p>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    I appeared (Ra'ah - appeared) to Abraham (Avraham - father of many), to Isaac (Yitzhak - he will laugh), and to Jacob (Ya'akov - heel grabber) as <a href="../Commentary/namesofgod.html">God Almighty (El Shaddai - God Almighty)</a>, but by my name the Lord (YHWH - He who Exists) I did not make myself known to them. </p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    I also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan (Kana'an - Canaan), the land in which they lived as sojourners. </p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel, whom the Egyptians hold as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant. </p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    Say therefore to the people of Israel, 'I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from slavery to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment.'</p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    I will take you to be my people, and I will be your God, and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. </p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham (Avraham - father of many), to Isaac (Yitzhak - he will laugh), and to Jacob (Ya'akov - heel grabber), and I will give it to you for a possession (Achuzah - possession). I am the Lord.'" </p>
