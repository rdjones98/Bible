    <h1>Exodus 1</h1>

    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    These are the names (Shem - names) of the sons (Bnei - sons) of Israel (Yisrael - God contends) who came to Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt) with Jacob (Yaakov - supplanted), each with his household (Bait - house):</p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    Reuben (Re'uven - behold, a son), Simeon (Shimon - heard), Levi (Levi - joined), Judah (Yehudah - praised),</p>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    Issachar (Yissachar - there is reward), Zebulun (Zevulun - dwelling), and Benjamin (Binyamin - son of the right hand),</p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    Dan (Dan - judged), Naphtali (Naftali - my struggle), Gad (Gad - fortune), Asher (Asher - happy),</p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    Issachar (Yissachar - there is reward), Zebulun (Zevulun - dwelling), and Benjamin (Binyamin - son of the right hand),</p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    Joseph (Yosef - he will add) and his brothers (Achim - brothers) all died (Muth - died),</p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    But the Israelites (Bnei - sons of Israel) were fruitful (Parah - fruitful) and increased greatly (Ravah - multiplied) and became exceedingly strong (Atzum - strong), so that the land was filled with them.</p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    Now there arose a new king (Melech - king) over Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt), who did not know Joseph (Yosef - he will add).</p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    And he said to his people, "Behold, the people of the children (Bnei - children) of Israel (Yisrael - God contends) are too many (Rav - many) and too mighty (Atzum - mighty) for us.</p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    Come, let us deal shrewdly (Hithal - deal wisely) with them, lest they multiply (Ravah - multiply), and, if war (Milchamah - war) breaks out, they join our enemies (Oyev - enemies) and fight against us and escape (Natsal - escape) from the land."</p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    Therefore they set (Sam - set) taskmasters (Sareh - officers) over them to afflict (Anah - afflict) them with heavy burdens (Sevel - burdens). They built (Banah - built) for Pharaoh store cities (Mishmeret - storehouses), Pithom (Pitom - ruins) and Ramses (Ra'amses - sun's son).</p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    But the more they were oppressed (Anah - oppressed), the more they multiplied (Ravah - multiplied) and the more they spread abroad (Pashat - spread). And the Egyptians (Mitzrim - Egyptians) were in dread (Kharadah - fear) of the people of Israel (Yisrael - God contends).</p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    So they ruthlessly (Chazak - made harsh) made the people of Israel (Yisrael - God contends) work (Avodah - work) as slaves (Avad - serve) and made their lives (Chayim - lives) bitter (Mar - bitter) with hard (Kasha - hard) service (Avodah - work) in mortar (Chemer - mortar) and brick (Leven - brick) and in all manner of work (Avodah - work) in the field (Sadeh - field); all their work (Avodah - work) they made them do with rigor (Chomah - severity).</p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    Then the king (Melech - king) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt) spoke to the Hebrew (Ivri - Hebrew) midwives (Meyaledet - midwives), one of whom was named Shiphrah (Shifrah - fair) and the other Puah (Pua - splendor).</p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    When you help the Hebrew women (Ivriah - Hebrew women) give birth (Yalad - birth), and see them on the birthstool (Avnat - stool), if it is a son (Ben - son), then you shall kill him, but if it is a daughter (Bat - daughter), then she shall live (Chayah - live)."</p>

    <p><strong>16. </strong>
    But the midwives (Meyaledet - midwives) feared (Yare - feared) God (Elohim - God) and did not do as the king (Melech - king) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt) commanded them, but let the male children (Ben - children) live.</p>

    <p><strong>17. </strong>
    So the king (Melech - king) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt) called (Qara - called) the midwives (Meyaledet - midwives) and said to them, "Why have you done this (Asah - done) and let the male children (Ben - children) live?"</p>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    The midwives (Meyaledet - midwives) said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women (Ivriah - Hebrew women) are not like the Egyptian women (Mitzrit - Egyptian women); for they are vigorous (Chayah - lively) and give birth (Yalad - give birth) before the midwife (Meyaledet - midwife) comes to them."</p>

    <p><strong>19. </strong>
    So God (Elohim - God) dealt well (Tov - dealt well) with the midwives (Meyaledet - midwives), and the people multiplied (Ravah - multiplied) and grew very strong (Atzum - strong).</p>

    <p><strong>20. </strong>
    And because the midwives (Meyaledet - midwives) feared (Yare - feared) God (Elohim - God), he gave them families (Banim - families).</p>

    <p><strong>21. </strong>
    Then Pharaoh commanded (Tzavah - commanded) all his people, saying, "Every son (Ben - son) that is born (Yulad - born) to the Hebrews (Ivrim - Hebrews) you shall cast (Shalak - cast) into the Nile (Yor - river), but every daughter (Bat - daughter) you shall let live (Chayah - live)."</p>
