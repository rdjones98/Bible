<h1>Exodus 30</h1>

<p>1 You (Moses) shall make an altar to burn incense on it; of acacia wood (shittim wood) you shall make it.</p>
<p>2 Its length shall be a cubit (about 18 inches), and its width a cubit; it shall be square, and its height shall be two cubits; its horns shall be of the same (wood).</p>
<p>3 You shall overlay it with pure gold (Zahav tahor), its top and its sides all around, and its horns; and you shall make a gold crown all around it.</p>
<p>4 You shall make two golden rings for it, under its crown, on its two sides, on opposite sides, you shall make them; and they shall be places for the poles to carry it with.</p>
<p>5 You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.</p>
<p>6 You shall place it before the veil that is before the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat (kaporet) that is over the testimony, where I will meet with you (YHWH, the LORD).</p>
<p>7 Aaron (Aaron, meaning "high mountain" or "exalted") shall burn on it incense every morning; when he sets up the lamps, he shall burn it.</p>
<p>8 When Aaron (Aaron) lights the lamps at dusk, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before the LORD (YHWH) throughout your generations.</p>
<p>9 You shall not offer any strange incense on it, nor burnt offering, nor grain offering; neither shall you pour a drink offering on it.</p>
<p>10 Aaron (Aaron) shall make atonement on its horns once a year, with the blood of the sin offering of atonements; once a year he shall make atonement on it throughout your generations; it is most holy to the LORD (YHWH).</p>

<h2>The Census Tax</h2>

<p>11 The LORD (YHWH) spoke to Moses (Moses, meaning "drawn out" or "saved from the water"),</p>
<p>12 When you take the census of the children of Israel (Yisrael, meaning "he who strives with God"), according to their number, then each one shall give a ransom for his soul to the LORD (YHWH), when you number them, so that no plague may come upon them when you number them.</p>
<p>13 This is what they shall give, everyone who is numbered, half a shekel, according to the shekel of the sanctuary (a shekel is twenty gerahs); half a shekel as an offering to the LORD (YHWH).</p>
<p>14 Everyone who is numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give the offering to the LORD (YHWH).</p>
<p>15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give the offering to the LORD (YHWH), to make atonement for your souls.</p>
<p>16 You shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel (Yisrael) and appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting (Ohel Moed), that it may bring a memorial for the children of Israel (Yisrael) before the LORD (YHWH), to make atonement for your souls.</p>

<h2>The Bronze Laver</h2>

<p>17 The LORD (YHWH) spoke to Moses (Moses),</p>
<p>18 You shall also make a laver (kior) of bronze, and its base also of bronze, for washing. You shall place it between the tent of meeting (Ohel Moed) and the altar, and you shall put water in it.</p>
<p>19 Aaron (Aaron) and his sons shall wash their hands and feet from it.</p>
<p>20 When they go into the tent of meeting (Ohel Moed), they shall wash with water so that they do not die; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire to the LORD (YHWH),</p>
<p>21 they shall wash their hands and their feet so that they do not die. This shall be a statute forever to them, to him and his descendants throughout their generations.</p>

<h2>The Anointing Oil</h2>

<p>22 The LORD (YHWH) spoke to Moses (Moses),</p>
<p>23 Take for yourself the finest spices: of pure myrrh (mor, meaning "bitter") five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon (qaneh bosem) two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus (kaneh bosem) two hundred and fifty shekels,</p>
<p>24 and of cassia (kesseh) five hundred shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil (shemen zayit) a hin;</p>
<p>25 And you shall make it into a holy anointing oil, a compound made by the perfumer, it shall be a holy anointing oil.</p>
<p>26 You shall anoint the tabernacle of meeting (Ohel Moed) with it, and the ark of the testimony,</p>
<p>27 and the table and all its vessels, and the lampstand and its vessels, and the altar of incense,</p>
<p>28 and the altar of burnt offering and all its vessels, and the laver and its base.</p>
<p>29 You shall consecrate them, that they may be most holy; whatever touches them shall be holy.</p>
<p>30 You shall anoint Aaron (Aaron) and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister to me as priests.</p>
<p>31 You shall speak to the children of Israel (Yisrael), saying, "This shall be a holy anointing oil to me throughout your generations."</p>
<p>32 It shall not be poured on human flesh, nor shall you make any like it in the same proportions. It is holy, and it shall be holy to you.</p>
<p>33 Whoever makes anything like it, or whoever puts any of it on a foreigner, shall be cut off from his people.</p>

<h2>The Incense</h2>

<p>34 The LORD (YHWH) spoke to Moses (Moses), Take for yourself sweet spices, stacte (nataph), onycha (shecheleth), and galbanum (helbena), sweet spices with pure frankincense (lebonah): of each there shall be an equal weight;</p>
<p>35 and you shall make it into a fragrant incense, a compound made by the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy;</p>
<p>36 and you shall beat some of it very fine, and put it before the testimony in the tabernacle of meeting (Ohel Moed), where I will meet with you (YHWH). It shall be most holy to you.</p>
<p>37 As for the incense which you shall make, you shall not make any for yourselves according to its composition. It shall be holy to the LORD (YHWH).</p>
<p>38 Whoever makes anything like it, or whoever puts any of it on a foreigner, shall be cut off from his people.</p>
