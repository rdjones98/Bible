Provide a literal translation of Exodus 17 from the Masoretic Text. Focus on capturing the Hebrew words and syntax as closely as possible, without smoothing or modernizing the phrasing, while maintaining clarity in English.  Give the meaning of all hebrew names in parenthesis beside the word.  Don't show the actual hebrew.  Also if a name of God that is used put that in parenthesis beside its translation.
