    <h1>Exodus 40</h1>
    <p><strong>1.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He is) spoke to Moses (Drawn Out), saying,</p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> “On the first day of the first month, you shall set up the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting.”</p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> “And you shall place there the Ark of the Testimony, and you shall cover the Ark with the veil.”</p>
    <p><strong>4.</strong> “And you shall bring in the table and arrange its arrangement, and you shall bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.”</p>
    <p><strong>5.</strong> “And you shall place the golden altar for incense before the Ark of the Testimony, and set up the screen of the entrance to the Tabernacle.”</p>
    <p><strong>6.</strong> “And you shall place the altar of burnt offering before the entrance of the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting.”</p>
    <p><strong>7.</strong> “And you shall place the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and you shall put water there.”</p>
    <p><strong>8.</strong> “And you shall set up the courtyard all around and set up the screen of the gate of the courtyard.”</p>
    <p><strong>9.</strong> “And you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the Tabernacle and all that is in it, and you shall sanctify it and all its utensils, and it shall be holy.”</p>
    <p><strong>10.</strong> “And you shall anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and sanctify the altar, and the altar shall be most holy.”</p>
    <p><strong>11.</strong> “And you shall anoint the basin and its stand, and sanctify it.”</p>
    <p><strong>12.</strong> “And you shall bring Aaron (Light Bringer) and his sons to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and you shall wash them with water.”</p>
    <p><strong>13.</strong> “And you shall clothe Aaron with the holy garments, and you shall anoint him and sanctify him, so that he shall serve as a priest to Me.”</p>
    <p><strong>14.</strong> “And you shall bring his sons and clothe them with tunics.”</p>
    <p><strong>15.</strong> “And you shall anoint them as you anointed their father, so that they shall serve as priests to Me, and their anointing shall be for them an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.”</p>
    <p><strong>16.</strong> And Moses did according to all that the Lord (YHWH - He is) commanded him, so he did.</p>
    <p><strong>17.</strong> And it was in the first month, in the second year, on the first day of the month, the Tabernacle was raised up.</p>
    <p><strong>18.</strong> And Moses raised up the Tabernacle and placed its sockets and set up its boards and put in its bars and raised up its pillars.</p>
    <p><strong>19.</strong> And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle and placed the covering of the tent above it, as the Lord (YHWH - He is) commanded Moses.</p>
    <p><strong>20.</strong> And he took the Testimony and placed it into the Ark, and he put the poles upon the Ark and placed the mercy seat above upon the Ark.</p>
    <p><strong>21.</strong> And he brought the Ark into the Tabernacle and set up the veil of the covering and covered over the Ark of the Testimony, as the Lord (YHWH - He is) commanded Moses.</p>
    <p><strong>22.</strong> And he placed the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the Tabernacle outside the veil.</p>
    <p><strong>23.</strong> And he arranged upon it the arrangement of bread before the Lord (YHWH - He is), as the Lord (YHWH - He is) commanded Moses.</p>
    <p><strong>24.</strong> And he placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting, opposite the table, on the south side of the Tabernacle.</p>
    <p><strong>25.</strong> And he set up the lamps before the Lord (YHWH - He is), as the Lord (YHWH - He is) commanded Moses.</p>
    <p><strong>26.</strong> And he placed the golden altar in the Tent of Meeting before the veil.</p>
    <p><strong>27.</strong> And he burned upon it incense of spices, as the Lord (YHWH - He is) commanded Moses.</p>
    <p><strong>28.</strong> And he set up the screen of the entrance to the Tabernacle.</p>
    <p><strong>29.</strong> And he placed the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting, and he offered upon it the burnt offering and the grain offering, as the Lord (YHWH - He is) commanded Moses.</p>
    <p><strong>30.</strong> And he placed the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and he put water there for washing.</p>
    <p><strong>31.</strong> And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet from it.</p>
    <p><strong>32.</strong> When they went into the Tent of Meeting and when they approached the altar, they washed, as the Lord (YHWH - He is) commanded Moses.</p>
    <p><strong>33.</strong> And he raised up the courtyard around the Tabernacle and the altar and set up the screen of the gate of the courtyard. And Moses finished the work.</p>
    <h2>The Glory of the Lord</h2>
	<p><strong>34.</strong> And the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the Lord (YHWH - He is) filled the Tabernacle.</p>
    <p><strong>35.</strong> And Moses was not able to enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud dwelled upon it, and the glory of the Lord (YHWH - He is) filled the Tabernacle.</p>
    <p><strong>36.</strong> And when the cloud was lifted from above the Tabernacle, the sons of Israel (God Strives) journeyed in all their journeys.</p>
    <p><strong>37.</strong> But if the cloud was not lifted, then they did not journey until the day it was lifted.</p>
    <p><strong>38.</strong> For the cloud of the Lord (YHWH - He is) was upon the Tabernacle by day, and fire was upon it by night, before the eyes of all the house of Israel (God Strives) in all their journeys.</p>
