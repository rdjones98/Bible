    <p><strong>1. </strong>

    And thou shalt set the altar (Mizbeach - altar) of the burnt offering (Olah - whole burnt offering) before the door (Sha'ar - gate) of the tabernacle (Mishkan - dwelling) of the tent (Ohel - tent of the congregation (Mo'ed - meeting)).</p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    And thou shalt set the laver (Kior - basin) between the tent (Ohel - tent) of the congregation (Mo'ed - meeting) and the altar (Mizbeach - altar), and shalt put water (Mayim - water) therein.</p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    And thou shalt set up the court (Chatzar - courtyard) round about, and hang up the hanging (Kor - curtain) at the court (Chatzar - courtyard) gate (Sha'ar - gate).</p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    And thou shalt take the anointing oil (Shemen - oil), and anoint the tabernacle (Mishkan - dwelling) and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels (Keilim - vessels) thereof: and it shall be holy (Kadosh - holy). </p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    And thou shalt anoint the altar (Mizbeach - altar) of the burnt offering (Olah - whole burnt offering), and all his vessels (Keilim - vessels), and sanctify the altar (Mizbeach - altar): and it shall be an altar (Mizbeach - altar most holy (Kadosh - holy)).</p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    And thou shalt anoint the laver (Kior - basin) and his foot (Yarekh - base), and sanctify it.</p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    And thou shalt bring Aaron (Aharon - exalted) and his sons (Banim - sons) unto the door (Sha'ar - gate) of the tabernacle (Mishkan - dwelling) of the congregation (Mo'ed - meeting), and wash them with water (Mayim - water).</p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    And thou shalt bring his sons (Banim - sons), and clothe them with coats (Ketonet - tunics):</p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>

    <p><strong>23. </strong>
    And he set the bread (Lechem - bread) in order upon it before the LORD (YHWH - I AM); as the LORD (YHWH - I AM) had commanded Moses (Mosheh - drawn out).</p>

    <p><strong>24. </strong>
    And he put the candlestick (Menorah - lampstand) in the tent (Ohel - tent) of the congregation (Mo'ed - meeting), over against the table (Shulchan - table), on the side of the tabernacle (Mishkan - dwelling, southward).</p>

    <p><strong>25. </strong>
    And he lighted the lamps (Nerot - lamps) before the LORD (YHWH - I AM); as the LORD (YHWH - I AM) commanded Moses (Mosheh - drawn out).</p>

    <p><strong>26. </strong>
    And he put the golden altar (Mizbeach - altar) in the tent (Ohel - tent) of the congregation (Mo'ed - meeting) before the veil (Parokheth - screen):</p>

    <p><strong>27. </strong>
    And he burnt sweet incense (Katorit - incense) thereon; as the LORD (YHWH - I AM) commanded Moses (Mosheh - drawn out).</p>

    <p><strong>28. </strong>
    And he set up the hanging (Kor - curtain) at the door (Sha'ar - gate) of the tabernacle (Mishkan - dwelling).</p>

    <p><strong>29. </strong>
    And he put the altar (Mizbeach - altar) of the burnt offering (Olah - whole burnt offering) by the door (Sha'ar - gate) of the tabernacle (Mishkan - dwelling) of the tent (Ohel - tent of the congregation (Mo'ed - meeting)), and offered upon it the burnt offering (Olah - whole burnt offering) and the meat offering (Minchah - meal offering); as the LORD (YHWH - I AM) commanded Moses (Mosheh - drawn out).</p>

    <p><strong>30. </strong>
    And he set the laver (Kior - basin) between the tent (Ohel - tent) of the congregation (Mo'ed - meeting) and the altar (Mizbeach - altar), and put water (Mayim - water) therein, to wash withal.</p>

    <p><strong>31. </strong>
    And Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - exalted) and his sons (Banim - sons) washed their hands (Yad - hands) and their feet (Raglaihem - feet) thereat:</p>

    <p><strong>32. </strong>
    When they went into the tent (Ohel - tent) of the congregation (Mo'ed - meeting), and when they came near unto the altar (Mizbeach - altar), they washed; as the LORD (YHWH - I AM) commanded Moses (Mosheh - drawn out).</p>

    <p><strong>33. </strong>
    And he reared up the court (Chatzar - courtyard) round about the tabernacle (Mishkan - dwelling) and the altar (Mizbeach - altar), and set up the hanging (Kor - curtain) of the court (Chatzar - courtyard) gate (Sha'ar - gate). So Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) finished the work (Ma'aseh - work).</p>

    <p><strong>34. </strong>
    Then a cloud (Anan - cloud) covered the tent (Ohel - tent) of the congregation (Mo'ed - meeting), and the glory (Kavod - glory) of the LORD (YHWH - I AM) filled the tabernacle (Mishkan - dwelling).</p>

    <p><strong>35. </strong>
    And Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) was not able to enter into the tent (Ohel - tent) of the congregation (Mo'ed - meeting), because the cloud (Anan - cloud) abode thereon, and the glory (Kavod - glory) of the LORD (YHWH - I AM) filled the tabernacle (Mishkan - dwelling).</p>

    <p><strong>36. </strong>
    And when the cloud (Anan - cloud) was taken up from over the tabernacle (Mishkan - dwelling), the children (Bnei - children) of Israel (Yisrael - God prevails) went onward, in all their journeys (Mas'ah - journeys):</p>

    <p><strong>37. </strong>
    But if the cloud (Anan - cloud) were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.</p>

    <p><strong>38. </strong>
    For the cloud (Anan - cloud) of the LORD (YHWH - I AM) was upon the tabernacle (Mishkan - dwelling) by day, and fire (Esh - fire) was on it by night, in the sight (Le'eynehem - sight) of all the house (Beit - house) of Israel (Yisrael - God prevails), throughout all their journeys (Mas'ah - journeys).</p>
