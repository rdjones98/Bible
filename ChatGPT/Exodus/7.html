    <h1>Exodus 7</h1>

    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    And the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "See, I have made you like God (Elohim - God) to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron (Aharon - exalted) shall be your prophet (Navi - prophet). </p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron (Aharon - exalted) shall tell Pharaoh to let the people of Israel (Yisrael - God contends) go (Shalach - send) out of his land. </p>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt), </p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    Pharaoh will not listen to you. Then I will lay (Shalach - send) my hand on Egypt and bring my hosts (Tzaba - armies), my people, the children (Banim - sons) of Israel (Yisrael - God contends), out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. </p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    The Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord (YHWH - Lord), when I stretch out my hand over Egypt and bring (Yats'a - bring out) the people of Israel (Yisrael - God contends) from among them." </p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - exalted) did just as the Lord (YHWH - Lord) commanded them. </p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    Now Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) was 80 years old, and Aaron (Aharon - exalted) was 83 years old when they spoke (Dabar - spoke) to Pharaoh. </p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    Then the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - exalted), </p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    "When Pharaoh says to you, 'Prove yourselves (Nasa - show) by working a miracle (Mopheth - miracle)', you shall say to Aaron (Aharon - exalted), 'Take your staff and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it may become (Haya - become) a serpent (Tanin - serpent).'" </p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    So Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - exalted) went to Pharaoh and did just as the Lord (YHWH - Lord) commanded. Aaron (Aharon - exalted) cast down his staff before Pharaoh and his servants (Avad - servants), and it became (Haya - became) a serpent (Tanin - serpent). </p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers, and they, the magicians of Egypt, also did the same by their secret arts (Kesem - magic). </p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    For each man (Ish - man) cast down his staff, and they became (Haya - became) serpents. But Aaron's (Aharon - exalted) staff swallowed up their staffs (Mateh - staffs). </p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    Still Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the Lord (YHWH - Lord) had said. </p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    Then the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "Pharaoh's heart is hardened; he refuses to let the people go (Shalach - send). </p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    Go (Bo - go) to Pharaoh in the morning; as he is going out to the water, stand on the bank of the Nile, and take in your hand the staff that turned into a serpent (Tanin - serpent). </p>

    <p><strong>16. </strong>
    And you shall say to him, 'The Lord (YHWH - Lord), the God (Elohim - God) of the Hebrews (Ivrim - Hebrews), sent me to you, saying, "Let my people go (Shalach - send), that they may serve (Avad - serve) me in the wilderness (Midbar - wilderness)"; but so far you have not obeyed (Shama - obeyed).'</p>

    <p><strong>17. </strong>
    Thus says (Amar - says) the Lord (YHWH - Lord), "By this you shall know that I am the Lord (YHWH - Lord): behold, with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile, and it shall turn into blood. </p>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    The fish in the Nile shall die (Muwt - die), and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will be unable (Yachal - unable) to drink water from the Nile.'" </p>

    <p><strong>19. </strong>
    And the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "Say to Aaron (Aharon - exalted), 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters (Mayim - waters) of Egypt, over their rivers (Nahar - rivers), over their canals (T'hol - canals), over their ponds (B'irot - ponds), and over all their pools (Maqor - pools), that they may become blood. And there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, even in vessels (Keli - vessels) of wood (Ets - wood) and in vessels (Keli - vessels) of stone (Even - stone).'" </p>

    <p><strong>20. </strong>
    Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - exalted) did as the Lord (YHWH - Lord) commanded. In the sight (Chazah - sight) of Pharaoh and his servants (Avad - servants), he lifted up (Nasa - lifted up) the staff and struc the water in the Nile, and all the water in the Nile turned into blood. </p>

    <p><strong>21. </strong>
    And the fish in the Nile died, and the Nile stank, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. There was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. </p>

    <p><strong>22. </strong>
    But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts (Kesem - magic), so Pharaohâ€™s heart remained hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the Lord (YHWH - Lord) had said. </p>

    <p><strong>23. </strong>
    Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this to heart. </p>

    <p><strong>24. </strong>
    And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile for water (Mayim - water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the Nile. </p>

    <p><strong>25. </strong>
    Seven days (Shivah - seven) passed after the Lord (YHWH - Lord) had struc the Nile. </p>
