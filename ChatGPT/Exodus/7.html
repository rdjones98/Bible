    <h1>Exodus 7 - Straightforward Translation</h1>

    <p><strong>1. </strong>
    And the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "See (Ra'ah - see), I have made you like God (Elohim - God) to Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh), and your brother (Ach - brother) Aaron (Aharon - exalted) shall be your prophet (Navi - prophet). </p>

    <p><strong>2. </strong>
    You shall speak (Dabar - speak) all that I command (Tsavah - command) you, and your brother (Ach - brother) Aaron (Aharon - exalted) shall tell (Dabar - tell) Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) to let the people (Am - people) of Israel (Yisrael - God contends) go (Shalach - send) out of his land (Eretz - land). </p>

    <p><strong>3. </strong>
    But I will harden (Chazak - harden) Pharaoh's (Par'oh - Pharaoh) heart (Lev - heart), and though I multiply (Rabah - multiply) my signs (Oth - signs) and wonders (Mopheth - wonders) in the land (Eretz - land) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt), </p>

    <p><strong>4. </strong>
    Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) will not listen (Shama - listen) to you. Then I will lay (Shalach - send) my hand (Yad - hand) on Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt) and bring (Bo - bring) my hosts (Tzaba - armies), my people (Am - people), the children (Banim - sons) of Israel (Yisrael - God contends), out of the land (Eretz - land) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt) by great judgments (Mishpat - judgment). </p>

    <p><strong>5. </strong>
    The Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egypt) shall know (Yadah - know) that I am the Lord (YHWH - Lord), when I stretch out (Natah - stretch out) my hand (Yad - hand) over Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt) and bring (Yats'a - bring out) the people (Am - people) of Israel (Yisrael - God contends) from among them." </p>

    <p><strong>6. </strong>
    Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - exalted) did (Asah - do) just as the Lord (YHWH - Lord) commanded (Tsavah - command) them. </p>

    <p><strong>7. </strong>
    Now Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) was 80 years (Shanah - years) old, and Aaron (Aharon - exalted) was 83 years (Shanah - years) old when they spoke (Dabar - spoke) to Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh). </p>

    <p><strong>8. </strong>
    Then the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - exalted), </p>

    <p><strong>9. </strong>
    "When Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) says to you, 'Prove yourselves (Nasa - show) by working (Asah - do) a miracle (Mopheth - miracle)', you shall say (Amar - say) to Aaron (Aharon - exalted), 'Take (Lakah - take) your staff (Mateh - staff) and cast it down (Natash - cast down) before Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh), that it may become (Haya - become) a serpent (Tanin - serpent).'" </p>

    <p><strong>10. </strong>
    So Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - exalted) went (Bo - went) to Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) and did (Asah - did) just as the Lord (YHWH - Lord) commanded (Tsavah - command). Aaron (Aharon - exalted) cast down (Natash - cast down) his staff (Mateh - staff) before Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) and his servants (Avad - servants), and it became (Haya - became) a serpent (Tanin - serpent). </p>

    <p><strong>11. </strong>
    Then Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) summoned (Qara - summoned) the wise men (Chakam - wise men) and the sorcerers (Khartumim - sorcerers), and they, the magicians (Lechash - magicians) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt), also did the same (Asah - did) by their secret arts (Kesem - magic). </p>

    <p><strong>12. </strong>
    For each man (Ish - man) cast down (Natash - cast down) his staff (Mateh - staff), and they became (Haya - became) serpents (Tanin - serpents). But Aaron's (Aharon - exalted) staff (Mateh - staff) swallowed up (Bala - swallowed up) their staffs (Mateh - staffs). </p>

    <p><strong>13. </strong>
    Still Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh)'s heart (Lev - heart) was hardened (Chazak - hardened), and he would not listen (Shama - listen) to them, as the Lord (YHWH - Lord) had said (Dabar - said). </p>

    <p><strong>14. </strong>
    Then the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh)'s heart (Lev - heart) is hardened (Chazak - hardened); he refuses (Mane'a - refuses) to let the people (Am - people) go (Shalach - send). </p>

    <p><strong>15. </strong>
    Go (Bo - go) to Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) in the morning (Boker - morning); as he is going out (Yatsa - going out) to the water (Mayim - water), stand (Amad - stand) on the bank (Suf - bank) of the Nile (Yor - Nile), and take (Lakah - take) in your hand (Yad - hand) the staff (Mateh - staff) that turned into a serpent (Tanin - serpent). </p>

    <p><strong>16. </strong>
    And you shall say (Amar - say) to him, 'The Lord (YHWH - Lord), the God (Elohim - God) of the Hebrews (Ivrim - Hebrews), sent (Shalach - sent) me to you, saying (Amar - saying), "Let my people (Am - people) go (Shalach - send), that they may serve (Avad - serve) me in the wilderness (Midbar - wilderness)"; but so far you have not obeyed (Shama - obeyed).'</p>

    <p><strong>17. </strong>
    Thus says (Amar - says) the Lord (YHWH - Lord), "By this you shall know (Yadah - know) that I am the Lord (YHWH - Lord): behold, with the staff (Mateh - staff) that is in my hand (Yad - hand) I will strike (Naga - strike) the water (Mayim - water) that is in the Nile (Yor - Nile), and it shall turn into blood (Dam - blood). </p>

    <p><strong>18. </strong>
    The fish (Dag - fish) in the Nile (Yor - Nile) shall die (Muwt - die), and the Nile (Yor - Nile) will stink (Sha'ar - stink), and the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egypt) will be unable (Yachal - unable) to drink (Shata - drink) water (Mayim - water) from the Nile (Yor - Nile).'" </p>

    <p><strong>19. </strong>
    And the Lord (YHWH - Lord) said to Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), "Say (Amar - say) to Aaron (Aharon - exalted), 'Take (Lakah - take) your staff (Mateh - staff) and stretch out (Natah - stretch out) your hand (Yad - hand) over the waters (Mayim - waters) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt), over their rivers (Nahar - rivers), over their canals (T'hol - canals), over their ponds (B'irot - ponds), and over all their pools (Maqor - pools), that they may become blood (Dam - blood). And there shall be blood (Dam - blood) throughout all the land (Eretz - land) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt), even in vessels (Keli - vessels) of wood (Ets - wood) and in vessels (Keli - vessels) of stone (Even - stone).'" </p>

    <p><strong>20. </strong>
    Moses (Mosheh - drawn out) and Aaron (Aharon - exalted) did (Asah - did) as the Lord (YHWH - Lord) commanded (Tsavah - command). In the sight (Chazah - sight) of Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) and his servants (Avad - servants), he lifted up (Nasa - lifted up) the staff (Mateh - staff) and struck (Naga - struck) the water (Mayim - water) in the Nile (Yor - Nile), and all the water (Mayim - water) in the Nile (Yor - Nile) turned into blood (Dam - blood). </p>

    <p><strong>21. </strong>
    And the fish (Dag - fish) in the Nile (Yor - Nile) died (Muwt - died), and the Nile (Yor - Nile) stank (Sha'ar - stank), so that the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egypt) could not drink (Shata - drink) water (Mayim - water) from the Nile (Yor - Nile). There was blood (Dam - blood) throughout all the land (Eretz - land) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt). </p>

    <p><strong>22. </strong>
    But the magicians (Lechash - magicians) of Egypt (Mitzrayim - Egypt) did the same (Asah - did) by their secret arts (Kesem - magic), so Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh)â€™s heart (Lev - heart) remained hardened (Chazak - hardened), and he would not listen (Shama - listen) to them, as the Lord (YHWH - Lord) had said. </p>

    <p><strong>23. </strong>
    Pharaoh (Par'oh - Pharaoh) turned and went (Bo - went) into his house (Beyt - house), and he did not take even this to heart (Lev - heart). </p>

    <p><strong>24. </strong>
    And all the Egyptians (Mitzrayim - Egypt) dug along the Nile (Yor - Nile) for water (Mayim - water to drink, for they could not drink (Shata - drink) the water (Mayim - water) of the Nile (Yor - Nile). </p>

    <p><strong>25. </strong>
    Seven days (Shivah - seven) passed after the Lord (YHWH - Lord) had struck (Naga - struck) the Nile (Yor - Nile). </p>
