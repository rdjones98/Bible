<h1>1 Samuel 28</h1>

<p><strong>1</strong> In those days, the Philistines (Pelishtim – Immigrants) gathered their armies for war to fight against Israel (Yisra’el – God strives). Achish (Akhish – I will blacken) said to David(David – Beloved), “You must surely know that you and your men are to go out with me in the army.”</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> David said to Achish, “Very well, you shall know what your servant can do.” And Achish said to David, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.”</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> Now Samuel (Shmu’el – Heard by God) had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah (Ramah – Height), his own city. Saul (Sha’ul – Asked for) had expelled the mediums and the spiritists from the land.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> The Philistines gathered and came and camped at Shunem (Shunem – Quiet resting place). Saul gathered all Israel, and they camped at Gilboa (Gilboa – Bubbling spring).</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> Saul inquired of the LORD (YHWH – He is), but the LORD did not answer him, neither by dreams nor by Urim nor by prophets.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> Then Saul said to his servants, “Seek out for me a woman who is a medium, so I may go to her and inquire of her.” His servants said to him, “There is a woman who is a medium at En-dor (En-dor – Spring of dwelling).”</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes and went, he and two men with him. They came to the woman by night. And he said, “Please divine for me by a spirit and bring up for me the one I name to you.”</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> But the woman said to him, “You know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why then are you laying a trap for my life to bring about my death?”</p>

<p><strong>10</strong> But Saul swore to her by the LORD, “As the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.”</p>

<p><strong>11</strong> Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” He said, “Bring up Samuel for me.”</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!”</p>

<p><strong>13</strong> The king said to her, “Do not be afraid. What do you see?” The woman said to Saul, “I see a god coming up out of the earth.”</p>

<p><strong>14</strong> He said to her, “What is his appearance?” She said, “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe.” And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and paid homage.</p>

<p><strong>15</strong> Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” Saul answered, “I am in great distress, for the Philistines are warring against me, and God (Elohim – Mighty Ones) has turned away from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have summoned you to tell me what I should do.”</p>

<p><strong>16</strong> Then Samuel said, “Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has turned from you and become your enemy?</p>

<p><strong>17</strong> The LORD has done to you as he spoke by me, for the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, to David.</p>

<p><strong>18</strong> Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD and did not carry out his fierce wrath against Amalek (Amalek – People of licking), therefore the LORD has done this thing to you today.</p>

<p><strong>19</strong> Moreover, the LORD will give Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me. The LORD will give the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.”</p>

<p><strong>20</strong> Then Saul fell at once full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel’s words. There was no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night.</p>

<p><strong>21</strong> Then the woman came to Saul, and when she saw that he was terrified, she said to him, “Behold, your servant has obeyed you. I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to what you said to me.</p>

<p><strong>22</strong> Now therefore, please listen also to your servant and let me set a morsel of bread before you. Eat, so that you may have strength when you go on your way.”</p>

<p><strong>23</strong> But he refused and said, “I will not eat.” But his servants, together with the woman, urged him, and he listened to them. So he rose from the ground and sat on the bed.</p>

<p><strong>24</strong> Now the woman had a fattened calf in the house, and she quickly killed it. And she took flour and kneaded it and baked unleavened bread of it,</p>

<p><strong>25</strong> and she brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.</p>
