<h1>1 Samuel 8</h1>

<p><sup>1</sup>And it came to pass, when Samuel (Sh'mu'el – Heard by God) was old, that he appointed his sons judges over Israel (Yisra’el – God strives).</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>The name of his firstborn son was Joel (Yoel – YHWH is God), and the name of his second was Abijah (Aviyah – My Father is YHWH); they were judges in Beersheba (Be’er Sheva – Well of the Oath).</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah (Ramah – Height).</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>They said to him, “Behold, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint for us a king to judge us like all the nations.”</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>But the thing was evil in the eyes of Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” So Samuel prayed to the LORD (YHWH – He is).</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>Andthe LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from reigning over them.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>Just as they have done to Me from the day I brought them up out of Egypt (Mitzrayim – Narrow Place) to this day—forsaking Me and serving other gods—so they are doing to you also.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>Now then, listen to their voice, but you must solemnly warn them and declare to them the ways of the king who shall reign over them.”</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>So Samuel told all the words ofthe LORD to the people who were asking him for a king.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>He said, “This will be the manner of the king who shall reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen, and they will run before his chariots.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war and the equipment for his chariots.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>He will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>He will take the best of your fields, vineyards, and olive groves and give them to his servants.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>He will take your male and female servants, and your best young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his work.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>And in that day you will cry out because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, butthe LORD will not answer you in that day.”</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and they said, “No! But there shall be a king over us,</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>so that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.”</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>When Samuel heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears ofthe LORD.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>Andthe LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice and appoint a king for them.” Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Each of you return to his city.”</p>
