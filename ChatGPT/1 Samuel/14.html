<h1>1 Samuel 14</h1>

<p><sup>1</sup>Now one day Jonathan (Yonatan – YHWH has given) the son of Saul (Sha’ul – Asked For) said to the young man who carried his armor, “Come, let us go over to the Philistine’s (Pelishtim – Immigrants) garrison on the other side.” But he did not tell his father.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah (Giv’ah – Hill) under the pomegranate tree in Migron (Migron – Precipice); the people who were with him were about six hundred men,</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>including Ahijah (Aḥiyah – My Brother is YHWH), the son of Ahitub (Aḥituv – My Brother is Good), Ichabod’s (Ikhavod – No Glory) brother, son of Phinehas (Pinḥas – Mouth of Brass), son of Eli (Eli – My God), the priest of YHWH (YHWH – He is) in Shiloh (Shiloh – Tranquility), wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>Within the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a rocky crag on one side and a rocky crag on the other side. The name of the one was Bozez (Botzetz – Shining), and the name of the other Seneh (Seneh – Thornbush).</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>One crag rose on the north in front of Michmash (Mikhmas – Hidden), and the other on the south in front of Geba (Geva – Hill).</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>Jonathan said to the young man who carried his armor, “Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that the LORD (YHWH – He is) will work for us, for nothing can hinder the LORD from saving by many or by few.”</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>And his armor-bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul.”</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will cross over to the men and show ourselves to them.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand still in our place and will not go up to them.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for the LORD has given them into our hand. And this shall be the sign to us.”</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, “Behold, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.”</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you something.” And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Come up after me, for the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives).”</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed them after him.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>And that first strike, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, killed about twenty men within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and the raiders trembled, and the earth quaked, and it became a very great trembling.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude was surging back and forth.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Count and see who has gone from us.” And when they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>So Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.” For the ark of God was at that time with the people of Israel.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>Now while Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle. And behold, every Philistine’s sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time, who had gone up with them into the camp, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>Likewise, when all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim (Efrayim – Fruitful) heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard after them in the battle.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup>So the LORD saved Israel that day. And the battle passed beyond Beth-aven (Beit-Aven – House of Vanity).</p>

<p><sup>24</sup>And the men of Israel were hard pressed that day. So Saul had laid an oath on the people, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup>Now all the people came into the forest, and there was honey on the ground.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup>And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was dropping, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup>But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath. So he put out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.</p>

<p><sup>28</sup>Then one of the people said, “Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food this day.’” And the people were faint.</p>

<p><sup>29</sup>Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. See how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey.</p>

<p><sup>30</sup>How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies that they found! For now the defeat among the Philistines has not been great.”</p>

<p><sup>31</sup>They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon (Ayalon – Place of Deer), and the people were very faint.</p>

<p><sup>32</sup>The people rushed on the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground. And the people ate them with the blood.</p>

<p><sup>33</sup>Then they told Saul, “Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood.” And he said, “You have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone to me here.”</p>

<p><sup>34</sup>And Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, ‘Let every man bring his ox or sheep and slaughter it here and eat, and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.’” So everyone brought his ox with him that night and slaughtered it there.</p>

<p><sup>35</sup>And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.</p>

<p><sup>36</sup>Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” But the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.”</p>

<p><sup>37</sup>And Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You give them into the hand of Israel?” But He did not answer him that day.</p>

<p><sup>38</sup>And Saul said, “Come here, all you leaders of the people, and know and see how this sin has arisen today.</p>

<p><sup>39</sup>For as the LORD lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.</p>

<p><sup>40</sup>Then he said to all Israel, “You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”</p>

<p><sup>41</sup>Therefore Saul said, “O LORD, God of Israel, give a perfect lot.” And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped.</p>

<p><sup>42</sup>Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son.” And Jonathan was taken.</
