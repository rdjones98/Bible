<h1>1 Samuel 24</h1>
<img src=24.gif>
<p><b>1</b> When Saul (Sha’ul – Asked for) returned from following the Philistines (Pelishtim – Immigrants), it was told him, “Look, David (Dawid – Beloved) is in the wilderness of En-gedi (‛Ein Gedi – Spring of the Young Goat).”</p>

<p><b>2</b> Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel (Yisra’el – God strives) and went to seek David and his men in front of the Rocks of the Wild Goats.</p>

<p><b>3</b> And he came to the sheepfolds along the way, where there was a cave. Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave.</p>

<p><b>4</b> Then the men of David said to him, “Look, this is the day of which the LORD said to you, ‘See, I will give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you.’” Then David arose and quietly cut off the corner of Saul’s robe.</p>

<p><b>5</b> Afterward, David’s heart struck him because he had cut off the corner of Saul’s robe.</p>

<p><b>6</b> And he said to his men, “The LORD (YHWH – He is) forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the LORD’s anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.”</p>

<p><b>7</b> So David restrained his men with these words and did not allow them to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way.</p>

<p><b>8</b> Then David also arose afterward and went out of the cave and called after Saul, saying, “My lord the king!” And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth and paid homage.</p>

<p><b>9</b> And David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘Look, David seeks your harm’?</p>

<p><b>10</b> Look, this day your eyes have seen how the LORD gave you today into my hand in the cave. And some told me to kill you, but I spared you. I said, ‘I will not stretch out my hand against my master, for he is the LORD’s (YHWH’s – He is) anointed.’</p>

<p><b>11</b> See, my father, look at the corner of your robe in my hand. For by cutting off the corner of your robe and not killing you, know and see that there is no evil or rebellion in my hand. I have not sinned against you, though you hunt me to take my life.</p>

<p><b>12</b> May the LORD judge between me and you, and may the LORD avenge me on you, but my hand shall not be against you.</p>

<p><b>13</b> As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes wickedness,’ but my hand shall not be against you.</p>

<p><b>14</b> After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom do you pursue? After a dead dog? After a single flea?</p>

<p><b>15</b> May the LORD therefore be judge and give sentence between me and you, and see and plead my cause and deliver me from your hand.”</p>

<p><b>16</b> When David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.</p>

<p><b>17</b> And he said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me good, whereas I have repaid you evil.</p>

<p><b>18</b> And you have shown this day how you have dealt well with me, that when the LORD gave me into your hand, you did not kill me.</p>

<p><b>19</b> For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safely? May the LORD reward you with good for what you have done to me this day.</p>

<p><b>20</b> And now, look, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.</p>

<p><b>21</b> Swear now therefore to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father’s house.”</p>

<p><b>22</b> And David swore this to Saul. Then Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.</p>
