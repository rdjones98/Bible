<h1>1 Samuel 1</h1>
<img src=1.png></img>
<p><sup>1</sup>There was a man from Ramathaim-zophim (Ramathayim-Tzofim – Two Heights of the Watchers), from the hill country of Ephraim (Efrayim – Fruitful), whose name was Elkanah (Elqanah – God has created), son of Jeroham (Yerocham – May he be shown mercy), son of Elihu (Elihu – He is my God), son of Tohu (Tochu – Sinking down), son of Zuph (Tzuph – Honeycomb), an Ephraimite.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>He had two wives: the name of one was Hannah (Channah – Grace), and the name of the other was Peninnah (Peninah – Pearl). Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>This man went up from his city year after year to worship and to offer sacrifices to the LORD (YHWH – He is) of hosts at Shiloh (Shiloh – Tranquility), where the two sons of Eli (Eli – My God), Hophni (Chofni – Boxer) and Phinehas (Pinchas – Nubian or Mouth of Brass), were priests of the LORD.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>On the day Elkanah offered his sacrifice, he gave portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the LORD had closed her womb.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>Her rival provoked her severely, to make her miserable, because the LORD had closed her womb.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>This happened year after year. Whenever she went up to the house of the LORD, Peninnah provoked her, and she would weep and not eat.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>Then Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don’t you eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh (Shiloh – Tranquility), Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>She was deeply distressed and prayed to the LORD, weeping bitterly.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>She made a vow, saying, “LORD of hosts (YHWH  Tzeva'ot – He is commander of armies), if You will truly look on the affliction of Your servant and remember me, and not forget Your servant, but will give Your servant a male child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.”</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli watched her mouth.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>And Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Put away your wine!”</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman of sorrowful spirit. I have not drunk wine or strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman. I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and grief.”</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>Then Eli answered, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel (Elohei Yisra’el) grant your request that you have asked of Him.”</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>She said, “Let your servant find favor in your sight.” Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD, then returned and came to their house at Ramah (Ramah – Height). And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>In due time, Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she named him Samuel (Sh'mu'el – Heard by God), for she said, “I asked him from the LORD.”</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>The man Elkanah went up with all his household to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and his vow offering.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “As soon as the boy is weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear before the LORD and remain there forever.”</p>

<p><sup>23</sup>Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may the LORD establish His word.” So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she weaned him.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup>When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. She brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh (Shiloh – Tranquility), and the child was young.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup>They slaughtered the bull and brought the boy to Eli.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup>She said, “Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you, praying to the LORD.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup>For this child I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my request that I made to Him.</p>

<p><sup>28</sup>Therefore I have also dedicated him to the LORD; as long as he lives, he is given to the LORD.” And he worshiped the LORD there.</p>
