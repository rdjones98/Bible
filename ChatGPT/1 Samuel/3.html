<h1>1 Samuel 3</h1>

<p><sup>1</sup>Now the boy Samuel (Shmuel – Heard by God) was ministering to the LORD (YHWH – He is) before Eli (Eli – My God). In those days the word of the LORD was rare; there were no frequent visions.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>And it came to pass at that time, as Eli was lying in his place—his eyes had begun to grow dim so that he could not see—</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was—</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>then the LORD called, “Samuel!” And he said, “Here I am!”</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>Then the LORD called again, “Samuel!” And Samuel rose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, my son; go back and lie down.”</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>Then the LORD called Samuel again, a third time. And he rose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the boy.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down, and if He calls you, you shall say, ‘Speak, the LORD, for Your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>And the LORD came and stood, calling as at the other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, for Your servant is listening.”</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>Then the LORD said to Samuel, “Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel (Yisra’el – God strives) at which the ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.”</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>And Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. But Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” And he said, “Here I am.”</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>And he said, “What was it that He told you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also if you hide anything from me of all that He said to you.”</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, “It is the LORD; let Him do what seems good to Him.”</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>And all Israel, from Dan (Dan – Judge) to Beersheba (Be’er Sheva – Well of the Oath), knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the LORD.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>And the LORD appeared again at Shiloh (Shiloh – Tranquility), for YHWH revealed Himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</p>
