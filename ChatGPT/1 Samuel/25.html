<h1>1 Samuel 25</h1>

<p><b>1</b> Then Samuel (Shemu’el – Heard by God) died, and all Israel (Yisra’el – God strives) gathered together and mourned for him, and they buried him at his house in Ramah (Ramah – Height). Then David (Dawid – Beloved) arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran (Paran – Place of Caves).</p>

<p><b>2</b> There was a man in Maon (Ma’on – Dwelling) whose business was in Carmel (Karmel – Garden land). The man was very rich; he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats, and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</p>

<p><b>3</b> Now the man’s name was Nabal (Naval – Fool), and his wife’s name was Abigail (Avigayil – My father is joy). She was a woman of good understanding and beautiful appearance, but the man was harsh and evil in his deeds. He was of the house of Caleb (Kalev – Dog, or Whole-hearted).</p>

<p><b>4</b> David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.</p>

<p><b>5</b> So David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.</p>

<p><b>6</b> Thus you shall say to him who lives in prosperity: ‘Peace be to you, and peace to your house, and peace to all that you have.</p>

<p><b>7</b> I have heard that you have shearers. Now your shepherds were with us, and we did not harm them, nor was anything missing from them all the while they were in Carmel.</p>

<p><b>8</b> Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes, for we come on a feast day. Please give whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.’”</p>

<p><b>9</b> When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in the name of David, and waited.</p>

<p><b>10</b> But Nabal answered David’s servants and said, “Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse (Yishai – My gift)? There are many servants nowadays who break away each one from his master.</p>

<p><b>11</b> Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men whom I do not know where they are from?”</p>

<p><b>12</b> So David’s young men turned away and went back, and they came and told him all these words.</p>

<p><b>13</b> Then David said to his men, “Every man gird on his sword!” So every man girded on his sword, and David also girded on his sword. And about four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies.</p>

<p><b>14</b> But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Look, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, and he scorned them.</p>

<p><b>15</b> But the men were very good to us, and we were not harmed, nor did we miss anything as long as we accompanied them, when we were in the fields.</p>

<p><b>16</b> They were a wall to us both by night and day, all the time we were with them keeping the sheep.</p>

<p><b>17</b> Now therefore know and consider what you will do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his household. For he is such a scoundrel that one cannot speak to him.”</p>

<p><b>18</b> Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys.</p>

<p><b>19</b> She said to her servants, “Go on before me; I am coming after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal.</p>

<p><b>20</b> So it was, as she rode on the donkey, that she came down under cover of the hill, and there were David and his men, coming down toward her, and she met them.</p>

<p><b>21</b> Now David had said, “Surely in vain I have protected all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him. And he has returned me evil for good.</p>

<p><b>22</b> May God (Elohim – Mighty Ones) do so, and more also, to the enemies of David if I leave until morning even one male of all who belong to him.”</p>

<p><b>23</b> When Abigail saw David, she hurried and dismounted from the donkey, fell on her face before David, and bowed to the ground.</p>

<p><b>24</b> So she fell at his feet and said: “On me, my lord, on me be the guilt! Please let your maidservant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your maidservant.</p>

<p><b>25</b> Please do not let my lord regard this scoundrel Nabal. For as his name is, so is he: Nabal (Naval – Fool) is his name, and folly is with him. But I, your maidservant, did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent.</p>

<p><b>26</b> Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD (YHWH – He is) lives and as your soul lives, since the LORD has restrained you from bloodguilt and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now let your enemies and those who seek evil against my lord be as Nabal.</p>

<p><b>27</b> And now let this blessing which your maidservant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord.</p>

<p><b>28</b> Please forgive the trespass of your maidservant. For the LORD will certainly make for my lord an enduring house, because my lord fights the battles of the LORD, and evil shall not be found in you all your days.</p>

<p><b>29</b> Even though someone rises to pursue you and seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God; and the lives of your enemies He shall sling out, as from the pocket of a sling.</p>

<p><b>30</b> And it shall come to pass, when the LORD has done to my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you ruler over Israel,</p>

<p><b>31</b> that this will be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. But when the LORD has dealt well with my lord, then remember your maidservant.”</p>

<p><b>32</b> Then David said to Abigail, “Blessed is the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!</p>

<p><b>33</b> And blessed is your discretion, and blessed are you, who have kept me this day from bloodguilt and from avenging myself with my own hand!</p>

<p><b>34</b> For as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me back from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, surely not one male of Nabal’s would have been left until the morning.”</p>

<p><b>35</b> So David received from her hand what she had brought him, and said to her, “Go up in peace to your house. See, I have listened to your voice and have accepted your gift.”</p>

<p><b>36</b> And Abigail came to Nabal, and he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until the morning light.</p>

<p><b>37</b> But in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</p>

<p><b>38</b> And about ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal, and he died.</p>

<p><b>39</b> When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the LORD, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back His servant from evil. The LORD has returned the evil of Nabal on his own head.” Then David sent and spoke to Abigail, to take her as his wife.</p>

<p><b>40</b> When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us to you to take you as his wife.”</p>

<p><b>41</b> Then she arose, bowed her face to the ground, and said, “Here is your maidservant, a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”</p>

<p><b>42</b> So Abigail quickly arose and rode on a donkey, with her five maidens attending her, and she followed the messengers of David and became his wife.</p>

<p><b>43</b> David also took Ahinoam (Ahinno‛am – My brother is delight) of Jezreel (Yizre‛el – God sows), and they both became his wives.</p>

<p><b>44</b> Now Saul (Sha’ul – Asked for) had given Michal (Mikhal – Who is like God?) his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti (Palti – My escape) the son of Laish (Layish – Lion), who was from Gallim (Gallim – Springs).</p>
