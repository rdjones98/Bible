<h1>1 Samuel 19</h1>

<p><b>1</b> Saul (Sha’ul – Asked for) told Jonathan (Yonatan – YHWH has given) his son and all his servants to put David (Dawid – Beloved) to death. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, delighted greatly in David.</p>

<p><b>2</b> So Jonathan warned David, saying, “Saul my father seeks to kill you. Now therefore, be on your guard in the morning, stay in a secret place and hide yourself.</p>

<p><b>3</b> I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you. If I learn anything, I will tell you.”</p>

<p><b>4</b> Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, “Let the king not sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds have been very beneficial to you.</p>

<p><b>5</b> For he took his life in his hand and struck down the Philistine (Pelishti – Immigrant), and the LORD (YHWH – He is) brought about a great salvation for all Israel (Yisra’el – God strives). You saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood by putting David to death without cause?”</p>

<p><b>6</b> Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, “As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death.”</p>

<p><b>7</b> Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these things. Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.</p>

<p><b>8</b> War broke out again, and David went out and fought with the Philistines and struck them with a great blow, and they fled before him.</p>

<p><b>9</b> Then an evil spirit from the LORD came upon Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand, while David was playing the lyre.</p>

<p><b>10</b> Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away from Saul’s presence, and Saul struck the spear into the wall. David fled and escaped that night.</p>

<p><b>11</b> Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him and to kill him in the morning. But Michal (Mikhal – Who is like God?), David’s wife, warned him, saying, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.”</p>

<p><b>12</b> So Michal let David down through the window, and he fled and escaped.</p>

<p><b>13</b> Michal took a household idol and laid it in the bed, put a pillow of goats’ hair at its head, and covered it with a garment.</p>

<p><b>14</b> When Saul sent messengers to seize David, she said, “He is sick.”</p>

<p><b>15</b> Then Saul sent the messengers back to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed so I may kill him.”</p>

<p><b>16</b> When the messengers came in, there was the idol in the bed with the pillow of goats’ hair at its head.</p>

<p><b>17</b> Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?” Michal said to Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go; why should I kill you?’”</p>

<p><b>18</b> So David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel (Shemu’el – Heard by God) at Ramah (Ramah – Height), and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went and stayed at Naioth.</p>

<p><b>19</b> It was told to Saul, “David is at Naioth (Nayot – Dwellings) in Ramah.”</p>

<p><b>20</b> So Saul sent messengers to capture David, and when they saw the company of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing as their leader, the Spirit of God (Elohim – Mighty Ones) came upon Saul’s messengers, and they also prophesied.</p>

<p><b>21</b> When Saul was told, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Saul sent messengers a third time, and they too prophesied.</p>

<p><b>22</b> Then he himself went to Ramah. When he came to the great well that is in Secu (Seku – Observation), he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” And someone said, “Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.”</p>

<p><b>23</b> So he went there to Naioth in Ramah, and the <a href="../Commentary/namesofholyspirit.html">Spirit of God (ruach Elohim)</a> came upon him also, and as he went along, he prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</p>

<p><b>24</b> He also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”</p>
