<h1>1 Samuel 17</h1>
<img src=17.gif>
<p><strong>1</strong> Now the Philistines (Pelishtim – Immigrants) gathered their armies for battle, and they assembled at Sokoh (Sokho – Thicket), which belongs to Judah (Yehudah – Praise), and encamped between Sokoh and Azekah (Azeiqah – Dug Over) in Ephes-dammim (Efes Damim – Boundary of Blood).</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Saul (Sha'ul – Asked For) and the men of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives) gathered and encamped in the Valley of Elah (Emek Ha’Elah – Valley of the Terebinth), and they drew up in battle line against the Philistines.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> The Philistines stood on the mountain on one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> A champion came out from the camp of the Philistines, named <a href="../Commentary/Goliath.html">Goliath (Golyat – Exile)</a>, from Gath (Gat – Winepress), whose height was six cubits and a span.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> He had a bronze helmet on his head, and he wore a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> He had bronze armor on his legs and a bronze javelin slung between his shoulders.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the iron point of his spear weighed six hundred shekels, and his shield bearer went before him.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, "Why have you come out to line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you will be our servants and serve us."</p>

<p><strong>10</strong> And the Philistine said, "I defy the ranks of Israel this day. Give me a man, that we may fight together."</p>

<p><strong>11</strong> When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> Now David (David – Beloved) was the son of an Ephrathite (Ephrathi – Fruitful) of Bethlehem in Judah (Beit Lechem – House of Bread in Yehudah – Praise), named Jesse (Yishai – Gift), who had eight sons. In the days of Saul, Jesse was old and advanced in years.</p>

<p><strong>13</strong> The three oldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle. The names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab (Eli’av – My God is Father) the firstborn, next to him Abinadab (Avinadav – My Father is Noble), and the third Shammah (Shammah – Desolation).</p>

<p><strong>14</strong> David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul,</p>
 
<p><strong>15</strong> but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem.</p>

<p><strong>16</strong> For forty days the Philistine came forward and took his stand, morning and evening.</p>

<p><strong>17</strong> Jesse said to his son David, "Take now for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers.</p>

<p><strong>18</strong> Also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand. See how your brothers are doing, and bring back a token from them."</p>

<p><strong>19</strong> Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah), fighting with the Philistines.</p>

<p><strong>20</strong> Early in the morning David rose, left the sheep with a keeper, took the supplies, and went as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the encampment as the army was going out to the battle line, shouting the war cry.</p>

<p><strong>21</strong> Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle line, army against army.</p>

<p><strong>22</strong> David left the things with the keeper of the supplies and ran to the ranks and went and greeted his brothers.</p>

<p><strong>23</strong> As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke the same words as before. And David heard him.</p>

<p><strong>24</strong> All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were very afraid.</p>

<p><strong>25</strong> And the men of Israel said, "Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel. And it shall be that the man who kills him the king will enrich with great riches, will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel."</p>

<p><strong>26</strong> David said to the men who stood by him, "What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God (Elohim – Mighty Ones)?"</p>

<p><strong>27</strong> And the people answered him the same way, "So shall it be done to the man who kills him."</p>

<p><strong>28</strong> Now Eliab (Eli’av – My God is Father) his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men, and Eliab's anger was kindled against David. He said, "Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the evil of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle."</p>

<p><strong>29</strong> David said, "What have I done now? Was it not just a question?"</p>

<p><strong>30</strong> He turned away from him toward another and spoke in the same way, and the people answered him again as before.</p>

<p><strong>31</strong> When the words that David spoke were heard, they repeated them before Saul, and he sent for him.</p>

<p><strong>32</strong> David said to Saul, "Let no man's heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine."</p>

<p><strong>33</strong> Saul said to David, "You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are but a youth, and he has been a man of war from his youth."</p>

<p><strong>34</strong> But David said to Saul, "Your servant used to keep sheep for his father. When a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock,</p>

<p><strong>35</strong> I went after it and struck it and delivered the lamb from its mouth. And if it rose against me, I caught it by its beard and struck it and killed it.</p>

<p><strong>36</strong> Your servant has struck down both lions and bears, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God (Elohim – Mighty Ones)."</p>

<p><strong>37</strong> And David said, "The LORD (YHWH – He is), who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine." And Saul said to David, "Go, and the LORD be with you."</p>

<p><strong>38</strong> Then Saul clothed David with his armor. He put a helmet of bronze on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail,</p>

<p><strong>39</strong> and David strapped his sword over his armor. And he tried in vain to go, for he had not tested them. Then David said to Saul, "I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them." So David put them off.</p>

<p><strong>40</strong> Then he took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the brook and put them in the shepherd's pouch. His sling was in his hand, and he approached the Philistine.</p>

<p><strong>41</strong> And the Philistine came on and drew near to David, with his shield bearer in front of him.</p>

<p><strong>42</strong> When the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was but a youth, ruddy and handsome in appearance.</p>

<p><strong>43</strong> And the Philistine said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</p>

<p><strong>44</strong> The Philistine said to David, "Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the field."</p>

<p><strong>45</strong> Then David said to the Philistine, "You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD (YHWH – He is) of hosts, the God (Elohim – Mighty Ones) of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.</p>

<p><strong>46</strong> This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head. And I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God (Elohim – Mighty Ones) in Israel,</p>

<p><strong>47</strong> and that all this assembly may know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear. For the battle is the LORD's, and He will give you into our hand."</p>

<p><strong>48</strong> When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.</p>

<p><strong>49</strong> David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.</p>

<p><strong>50</strong> So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. There was no sword in the hand of David.</p>

<p><strong>51</strong> Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.</p>

<p><strong>52</strong> And the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron (Eqron – Uprooting), so that the wounded Philistines fell on the way from Shaaraim (Sha’araim – Two Gates) as far as Gath and Ekron.</p>

<p><strong>53</strong> And the people of Israel came back from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.</p>

<p><strong>54</strong> And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem (Yerushalayim – Foundation of Peace), but he put his armor in his tent.</p>

<p><strong>55</strong> When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner (Avner – My Father is a Lamp), the commander of the army, "Abner, whose son is this youth?" And Abner said, "As your soul lives, O king, I do not know."</p>

<p><strong>56</strong> And the king said, "Inquire whose son the boy is."</p>

<p><strong>57</strong> And as David returned from striking down the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</p>

<p><strong>58</strong> And Saul said to him, "Whose son are you, young man?" And David answered, "I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite (Beit ha-Lachmi – from the House of Bread)."</p>
