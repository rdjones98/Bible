<h1>1 Samuel 20</h1>

<p><b>1</b> Then David (Dawid – Beloved) fled from Naioth (Nayot – Dwellings) in Ramah (Ramah – Height) and came and said to Jonathan (Yonatan – YHWH has given), “What have I done? What is my guilt? What is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?”</p>

<p><b>2</b> Jonathan said to him, “Far from it! You shall not die. Look, my father does nothing great or small without revealing it to me. Why would my father hide this from me? It is not so.”</p>

<p><b>3</b> But David vowed again and said, “Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.’ But truly, as the LORD lives, and as you live, there is but a step between me and death.”</p>

<p><b>4</b> Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.”</p>

<p><b>5</b> David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the New Moon, and I should not fail to sit at table with the king. But let me go, so that I may hide in the field until the third evening.</p>

<p><b>6</b> If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem (Beit-Lechem – House of Bread), his city, because there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the clan.’</p>

<p><b>7</b> If he says, ‘Good!’ then it is well with your servant. But if he becomes angry, then know that harm is determined by him.</p>

<p><b>8</b> Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD (YHWH – He is) with you. But if there is guilt in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?”</p>

<p><b>9</b> Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! If I knew that harm was determined by my father to come upon you, would I not tell you?”</p>

<p><b>10</b> Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?”</p>

<p><b>11</b> Jonathan said to David, “Come, let us go out into the field.” So they both went out into the field.</p>

<p><b>12</b> Jonathan said to David, “By the LORD, the God (Elohim – Mighty Ones) of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives), when I have sounded out my father, about this time tomorrow or the third day, and behold, if he is well disposed toward David, shall I not then send and disclose it to you?</p>

<p><b>13</b> But if it pleases my father to do you harm, may the LORD do so to Jonathan and more also, if I do not disclose it to you and send you away, so that you may go in peace. May the LORD be with you as He has been with my father.</p>

<p><b>14</b> If I am still alive, show me the steadfast love of the LORD, that I may not die.</p>

<p><b>15</b> And do not cut off your steadfast love from my house forever, even when the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.”</p>

<p><b>16</b> So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the LORD take vengeance on David’s enemies.”</p>

<p><b>17</b> And Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him, for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</p>

<p><b>18</b> Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the New Moon, and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.</p>

<p><b>19</b> On the third day, go down quickly to the place where you hid yourself when this matter began, and remain beside the stone heap.</p>

<p><b>20</b> And I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.</p>

<p><b>21</b> And behold, I will send the boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you, take them,’ then come, for there is peace for you and no danger, as the LORD lives.</p>

<p><b>22</b> But if I say to the youth, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then go, for the LORD has sent you away.</p>

<p><b>23</b> And as for the matter you and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD is between you and me forever.”</p>

<p><b>24</b> So David hid in the field. And when the New Moon came, the king sat down to eat food.</p>

<p><b>25</b> The king sat on his seat, as at other times, on the seat by the wall. Jonathan sat opposite, and Abner (Avner – My father is a lamp) sat by Saul’s (Sha’ul – Asked for) side, but David’s place was empty.</p>

<p><b>26</b> Yet Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, “Something has happened to him; he is not clean—surely he is not clean.”</p>

<p><b>27</b> But on the second day, the day after the New Moon, David’s place was still empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why has the son of Jesse (Yishai – Gift) not come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”</p>

<p><b>28</b> Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem.</p>

<p><b>29</b> He said, ‘Please let me go, for our clan holds a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me go away to see my brothers.’ For this reason he has not come to the king’s table.”</p>

<p><b>30</b> Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse and rebellious woman, do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse (Yishai – Gift) to your own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?</p>

<p><b>31</b> For as long as the son of Jesse (Yishai – Gift) lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom shall be established. Therefore send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.”</p>

<p><b>32</b> Then Jonathan answered Saul his father, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”</p>

<p><b>33</b> But Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him. So Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.</p>

<p><b>34</b> Jonathan rose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food on the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had disgraced him.</p>

<p><b>35</b> In the morning Jonathan went out into the field to the appointment with David, and a little boy was with him.</p>

<p><b>36</b> And he said to his boy, “Run and find the arrows that I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</p>

<p><b>37</b> When the boy came to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the boy and said, “Is not the arrow beyond you?”</p>

<p><b>38</b> And Jonathan called after the boy, “Hurry! Be quick! Do not stay!” So Jonathan’s boy gathered up the arrows and came to his master.</p>

<p><b>39</b> But the boy knew nothing. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</p>

<p><b>40</b> And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him, “Go, carry them to the city.”</p>

<p><b>41</b> As soon as the boy had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap and fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times. They kissed one another and wept with one another, though David wept the more.</p>

<p><b>42</b> Then Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, because we have sworn, both of us, in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘The LORD shall be between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring, forever.’” And he rose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.</p>
