<h1>1 Samuel 9</h1>

<p><sup>1</sup>There was a man of Benjamin (Binyamin – Son of the Right Hand), whose name was Kish (Qish – Bow), the son of Abiel (Avi’el – My Father is God), son of Zeror (Tzeror – Bundle), son of Becorath (Bekorat – Firstborn), son of Aphiah (Afiyaḥ – I will cause to blow), a Benjamite, a man of wealth.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>He had a son whose name was Saul (Sha’ul – Asked For), a handsome young man. There was not a man among the people of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives) more handsome than he. From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. So Kish said to Saul his son, “Take one of the young men with you, and arise, go and look for the donkeys.”</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>And he passed through the hill country of Ephraim (Efrayim – Fruitfulness) and passed through the land of Shalishah (Shalishah – Third part), but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim (Shaalim – Foxes), but they were not there. Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>When they came to the land of Zuph (Tzuph – Honeycomb), Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us go back, lest my father stop caring about the donkeys and become anxious about us.”</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>But he said to him, “Behold, there is a man of God in this city, and he is a man held in honor. All that he says surely comes true. Now let us go there. Perhaps he can tell us the way we should go.”</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>Then Saul said to his servant, “But if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread in our sacks is gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?”</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>The servant answered Saul again, “Behold, I have with me a quarter of a shekel of silver, and I will give it to the man of God to tell us our way.”</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he said, “Come, let us go to the seer,” for today’s prophet was formerly called a seer.)</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>Then Saul said to his servant, “Well said; come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>As they went up the hill to the city, they met young women coming out to draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer here?”</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>They answered, “He is. Behold, he is just ahead of you. Hurry now, for he has come just today to the city, because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>As soon as you enter the city, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not eat until he comes, for he must bless the sacrifice. Afterward those invited will eat. Now go up, for you will meet him immediately.”</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>So they went up to the city. As they were entering the city, behold, Samuel (Sh'mu'el – Heard by God) came out toward them on his way up to the high place.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>Now YHWH (YHWH – He is) had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>“Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him prince over My people Israel. He shall save My people from the hand of the Philistines (Pelishtim – Immigrants), for I have seen My people, because their cry has come to Me.”</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>When Samuel saw Saul, YHWH (YHWH – He is) told him, “Here is the man of whom I spoke to you! This one shall rule over My people.”</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>Then Saul approached Samuel in the gate and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.”</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>Samuel answered Saul, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for today you shall eat with me. In the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them, for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father’s house?”</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>And Saul answered, “Am I not a Benjamite, from the least of the tribes of Israel? And is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in this way?”</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited—about thirty persons.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup>And Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion I gave you, of which I said to you, ‘Put it aside.’”</p>

<p><sup>24</sup>So the cook took up the thigh and what was on it and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, “See, what was kept is set before you. Eat, because it was kept for you for this appointed time, when I said, ‘I have invited the people.’” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup>When they came down from the high place into the city, he talked with Saul on the roof.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup>And they rose early. And about daybreak, Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get up, that I may send you on your way.” So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went out into the street.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup>As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to pass on before us”—and he passed on—“but you stand still for a while, that I may make known to you the word of God.”</p>
