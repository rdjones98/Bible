<h1>1 Samuel 21</h1>

<img src=21.jpg>
<p><b>1</b> Then David (Dawid – Beloved) came to Nob (Nov – High Place) to Ahimelech (Achimelekh – My brother is king) the priest. And Ahimelech came trembling to meet David and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no one with you?”</p>

<p><b>2</b> David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has charged me with a matter and said to me, ‘Let no one know anything of the matter about which I send you, and with which I have charged you.’ I have made an appointment with the young men at such and such a place.</p>

<p><b>3</b> Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here.”</p>

<p><b>4</b> The priest answered David and said, “There is no ordinary bread on hand, but there is holy bread—if the young men have kept themselves from women.”</p>

<p><b>5</b> David answered the priest, “Indeed, women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition. The vessels of the young men are holy even when it is an ordinary journey; how much more then today will their vessels be holy?”</p>

<p><b>6</b> So the priest gave him the holy bread, for there was no bread there but the Bread of the Presence, which is taken from before the LORD, to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away.</p>

<p><b>7</b> Now a certain man of the servants of Saul (Sha’ul – Asked for) was there that day, detained before the LORD (YHWH – He is). His name was Doeg (Do'eg – Fearful) the Edomite (Edomi – Red One), the chief of Saul’s herdsmen.</p>

<p><b>8</b> Then David said to Ahimelech, “Then have you not here a spear or a sword at hand? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's matter was urgent.”</p>

<p><b>9</b> The priest said, “The sword of Goliath (Golyat – Exile) the Philistine (Pelishti – Immigrant), whom you struck down in the Valley of Elah (Elah – Terebinth Tree), behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it, for there is none but that here.” And David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”</p>

<p><b>10</b> And David rose and fled that day from Saul and went to Achish (Akhish – I will blacken) the king of Gath (Gat – Winepress).</p>

<p><b>11</b> The servants of Achish said to him, “Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another of him in dances, ‘Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands’?”</p>

<p><b>12</b> David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</p>

<p><b>13</b> So he changed his behavior before them and pretended to be insane in their hands and made marks on the doors of the gate and let his saliva run down his beard.</p>

<p><b>14</b> Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me?</p>

<p><b>15</b> Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to behave as a madman in my presence? Shall this one come into my house?”</p>
