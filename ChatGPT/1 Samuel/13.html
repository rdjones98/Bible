<h1>1 Samuel 13</h1>
<img src=13.webp width=98%>

<p><sup>1</sup>Saul (Sha’ul – Asked For) was [thirty] years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for [two] years over Israel (Yisra’el – God strives).</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Saul chose for himself three thousand men of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash (Mikhmas – Hidden) and in the hill country of Bethel (Beit-El – House of God), and a thousand were with Jonathan (Yonatan – YHWH has given) in Gibeah (Giv’ah – Hill) of Benjamin (Binyamin – Son of the Right Hand). The rest of the people he sent home, every man to his tent.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines (Pelishtim – Immigrants) that was at Geba (Geva – Hill), and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews (Ivrim – Those from beyond) hear.”</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>And all Israel heard it said that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become a stench to the Philistines. And the people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal (Gilgal – Rolling).</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>And the Philistines gathered to fight with Israel—thirty thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and troops like the sand on the seashore in multitude. They came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven (Beit-Aven – House of Vanity).</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble (for the people were hard pressed), they hid themselves in caves, in thickets, among rocks, in holes, and in cisterns.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>And some Hebrews crossed the fords of the Jordan (Yarden – Descender) to the land of Gad (Gad – Fortune) and Gilead (Gil’ad – Perpetual Fountain). But Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>He waited seven days, the time appointed by Samuel (Sh'mu'el – Heard by God), but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>So Saul said, “Bring the burnt offering here to me, and the peace offerings.” And he offered the burnt offering.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came. And Saul went out to meet him and to greet him.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>Samuel said, “What have you done?” And Saul said, “When I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the appointed days, and that the Philistines had mustered at Michmash,</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of the LORD (YHWH - He is).’ So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering.”</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>And Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly. You have not kept the command of the LORD your God, which He commanded you. For then the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>But now your kingdom shall not continue. the LORD has sought a man after His own heart, and the LORD has appointed him to be ruler over His people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you.”</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>And Saul and Jonathan his son and the people who were present with them stayed in Geba of Benjamin, but the Philistines encamped at Michmash.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned toward Ophrah (Ofrah – Fawn) to the land of Shual (Shu’al – Fox),</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>another company turned toward Beth-horon (Beit-Horon – House of the Hollow), and another company turned toward the border that looks down on the Valley of Zeboim (Gē HaTzevo’im – Valley of Hyenas) toward the wilderness.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>Now there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears.”</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>But every one of the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, or his sickle,</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>and the charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshares and for the mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and for setting the goads.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>So on the day of the battle there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan, but Saul and Jonathan his son had them.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.</p>
