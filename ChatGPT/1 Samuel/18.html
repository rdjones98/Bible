<h1>1 Samuel 18</h1>

<p><b>1</b> After David (David – Beloved) had finished speaking with Saul (Sha’ul – Asked For), the soul of Jonathan (Yonatan – YHWH Has Given) was bound to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.</p>

<p><b>2</b> Saul took him that day and would not let him return to his father’s house.</p>

<p><b>3</b> Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul.</p>

<p><b>4</b> Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, and also his armor, even his sword, his bow, and his belt.</p>

<p><b>5</b> David went out wherever Saul sent him and acted wisely. And Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the eyes of all the people and also in the eyes of Saul’s servants.</p>

<p><b>6</b> As they were coming home, when David returned from striking down the Philistine(Pelishti – Immigrant), the women came out from all the towns of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul with tambourines, with joy, and with musical instruments.</p>

<p><b>7</b> The women sang to one another as they celebrated:
“Saul has struck down his thousands,
    and David his ten thousands.”</p>

<p><b>8</b> Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him. He said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands. What more can he have but the kingdom?”</p>

<p><b>9</b> So Saul eyed David from that day on.</p>

<p><b>10</b> The next day a harmful spirit from God (Elohim – Mighty Ones) rushed upon Saul, and he raved within his house while David was playing the lyre, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand,</p>

<p><b>11</b> and Saul hurled the spear, for he thought, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David evaded him twice.</p>

<p><b>12</b> Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD (YHWH – He is) was with him but had departed from Saul.</p>

<p><b>13</b> So Saul removed him from his presence and made him a commander of a thousand. And he went out and came in before the people.</p>

<p><b>14</b> And David acted wisely in all his ways, and the LORD was with him.</p>

<p><b>15</b> When Saul saw that he acted very wisely, he was afraid of him.</p>

<p><b>16</b> But all Israel (Yisra’el – God Strives) and Judah (Yehudah – Praise) loved David, for he went out and came in before them.</p>

<p><b>17</b> Then Saul said to David, “Here is my elder daughter Merab (Merav – Increase). I will give her to you as a wife; only be valiant for me and fight the battles of the LORD.” For Saul thought, “Let not my hand be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines (Pelishtim – Immigrants) be against him.”</p>

<p><b>18</b> And David said to Saul, “Who am I, and who are my relatives, my father's clan in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?”</p>

<p><b>19</b> But at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel (Adri’el – Flock of God) the Meholathite (Mecholati – From Meholah, meaning "Dance") as a wife.</p>

<p><b>20</b> Now Michal (Mikhal – Who is Like God?), Saul’s daughter, loved David. And they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.</p>

<p><b>21</b> Saul thought, “I will give her to him, that she may be a snare for him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” Therefore Saul said to David a second time, “You shall now be my son-in-law.”</p>

<p><b>22</b> And Saul commanded his servants, “Speak to David in private and say, ‘Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now then become the king’s son-in-law.’”</p>

<p><b>23</b> Saul’s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. But David said, “Does it seem to you a light thing to become the king’s son-in-law, since I am a poor man and have no reputation?”</p>

<p><b>24</b> And the servants of Saul told him, “This is what David said.”</p>

<p><b>25</b> Then Saul said, “Say this to David: ‘The king desires no bride-price except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the king’s enemies.’” Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</p>

<p><b>26</b> When his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law. Before the days had expired,</p>

<p><b>27</b> David rose and went, he and his men, and struck down two hundred of the Philistines. And David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might become the king’s son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter for a wife.</p>

<p><b>28</b> But when Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him,</p>

<p><b>29</b> Saul was even more afraid of David. So Saul was David’s enemy continually.</p>

<p><b>30</b> Then the commanders of the Philistines came out to battle, and as often as they came out, David had more success than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was highly esteemed.</p>
