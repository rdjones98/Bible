<h1>1 Samuel 2</h1>

<p><sup>1</sup>Then Hannah (Channah – Grace) prayed and said: “My heart exults in the LORD (YHWH – He is); my horn is lifted high in the LORD. My mouth speaks boldly against my enemies, because I rejoice in Your salvation.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>There is none holy like the LORD; indeed, there is no one besides You, nor is there any rock like our God.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>Stop speaking so proudly; let no arrogance come from your mouth. For the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by Him actions are weighed.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>The bows of the mighty are broken, but those who stumbled are girded with strength.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but the hungry have ceased to hunger. Even the barren has borne seven, and she who had many children is forlorn.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>the LORD kills and brings to life; He brings down to Sheol and raises up.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>the LORD makes poor and makes rich; He brings low and lifts up.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>He raises the poor from the dust; He lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth are the LORD’s, and He has set the world upon them.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>He will guard the feet of His faithful ones, but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness, for not by strength shall a man prevail.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>Those who oppose the LORD will be shattered. He will thunder against them from the heavens. the LORD will judge the ends of the earth. He will give strength to His king and exalt the horn of His anointed one (Mashiach - root word of Messiah).”</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>Then Elkanah (Elqanah – God has created) went to Ramah (Ramah – Height) to his house, and the boy served the LORD in the presence of Eli (Eli – My God) the priest.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>Now the sons of Eli were worthless men; they did not know the LORD.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>The custom of the priests with the people was that when anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand,</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>and he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or pot. All that the fork brought up, the priest would take for himself. This is what they did to all the Israelites (Yisra’el – God strives) who came to Shiloh (Shiloh – Tranquility).</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give meat to the priest to roast, for he will not take boiled meat from you, only raw.”</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>And if the man said, “Let them burn the fat first, and then take whatever you wish,” he would reply, “No, you must give it now, and if not, I will take it by force.”</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the LORD, for the men treated the offering of the LORD with contempt.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>But Samuel (Shmuel – Heard by God) ministered before the LORD, a boy wearing a linen ephod.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>His mother made him a little robe and brought it to him year by year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, “May the LORD give you offspring from this woman in place of the one she dedicated to the LORD.” And they would return to their home.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>Indeed, the LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew in the presence of the LORD.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup>He said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup>No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear the people of the LORD spreading abroad.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup>If a man sins against another, God may mediate for him, but if a man sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?” But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for it was the will of the LORD to put them to death.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup>Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the LORD and with people.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup>Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Did I not clearly reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt, subject to the house of Pharaoh?</p>

<p><sup>28</sup>I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up to My altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod before Me; and I gave to the house of your father all the offerings by fire from the people of Israel.</p>

<p><sup>29</sup>Why then do you scorn My sacrifices and My offerings that I commanded for My dwelling, and honor your sons above Me by fattening yourselves on the choicest parts of every offering of My people Israel?’</p>

<p><sup>30</sup>Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: ‘I promised that your house and the house of your father should go in and out before Me forever,’ but now the LORD declares: ‘Far be it from Me, for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me shall be lightly esteemed.’</p>

<p><sup>31</sup>Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father’s house, so that there will not be an old man in your house.</p>

<p><sup>32</sup>Then you will look with distress at all the prosperity that will be bestowed on Israel, and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.</p>

<p><sup>33</sup>The only one of you whom I shall not cut off from My altar shall be spared to weep his eyes out and to grieve his heart, and all the descendants of your house shall die by the sword of men.</p>

<p><sup>34</sup>This shall be the sign to you that will come upon your two sons, Hophni (Chofni – Boxer) and Phinehas (Pinchas – Nubian or Mouth of Brass): on the same day they shall both die.</p>

<p><sup>35</sup>And I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in My heart and in My mind. I will build him a sure house, and he shall go in and out before My anointed one forever.</p>

<p><sup>36</sup>And everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread, and shall say, ‘Please appoint me to one of the priestly offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.’”</p>
