  <h1>Joshua (Yehoshua - YHWH is salvation) Chapter 2</h1>

  <p>1 And Joshua (Yehoshua - YHWH is salvation) son of Nun (Nun - fish or posterity) sent from Shittim (Shittim - acacia trees) two men, spies secretly, saying, "Go, see the land and Jericho (Yericho - fragrance)." And they went and came into the house of a woman, a prostitute, and her name was Rahab (Rachav - broad), and they lay down there.</p>

  <p>2 And it was told to the king of Jericho, saying, "Behold, men have come here tonight from the children of Israel (Yisrael - he struggles with God) to search out the land."</p>

  <p>3 And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab (Rachav - broad), saying, "Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land."</p>

  <p>4 And the woman took the two men and hid them, and she said, "Indeed, the men came to me, but I did not know from where they were."</p>

  <p>5 "And it was, when the gate was to be shut in the darkness, that the men went out. I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them."</p>

  <p>6 But she had brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax, arranged for her on the roof.</p>

  <p>7 And the men pursued them on the way to the Jordan (Yarden - descender), to the fords. And they shut the gate after the pursuers had gone out after them.</p>

  <p>8 And before they lay down, she went up to them on the roof,</p>

  <p>9 and she said to the men, "I know that the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) has given you the land, and that your terror has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted before you."</p>

  <p>10 "For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Sea of Reeds before you when you came out of Egypt (Mitzrayim - narrow places), and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites (Emori - talkers), who were beyond the Jordan (Yarden - descender), to Sihon (Sichon - sweeping away) and to Og (Og - long-necked), whom you devoted to destruction."</p>

  <p>11 "And we heard, and our hearts melted, and there did not arise again spirit in any man because of you, for the Lord your God (YHWH Eloheichem), He is God (Elohim) in the heavens above and on the earth beneath."</p>

  <p>12 "And now, please swear to me by the Lord, for I have shown you kindness, that you will also show kindness to the house of my father, and give to me a true sign,"</p>

  <p>13 "and save alive my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters and all that belongs to them, and deliver our souls from death."</p>

  <p>14 And the men said to her, "Our soul for yours, to die—if you do not tell this business of ours, then it shall be, when the Lord gives us the land, we will deal with you in kindness and truth."</p>

  <p>15 Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was in the wall of the city, and she dwelled in the wall.</p>

  <p>16 And she said to them, "Go to the hill country, lest the pursuers meet you, and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers return, and afterward you may go your way."</p>

  <p>17 And the men said to her, "We will be guiltless of this your oath which you made us swear—"</p>

  <p>18 "Behold, when we come into the land, you shall tie this cord of scarlet thread in the window by which you let us down. And you shall gather into your house your father and your mother and your brothers and all your father’s household."</p>

  <p>19 "And it shall be, anyone who goes out from the doors of your house, his blood shall be on his head, and we will be guiltless. And anyone who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head if a hand is upon him."</p>

  <p>20 "But if you declare this matter of ours, then we will be guiltless of your oath which you made us swear."</p>

  <p>21 And she said, "According to your words, so be it." And she sent them away, and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.</p>

  <p>22 And they went and came to the hill country and stayed there three days, until the pursuers returned. And the pursuers searched all along the way and did not find them.</p>

  <p>23 And the two men returned and came down from the hill country and crossed over and came to Joshua son of Nun (Nun - fish or posterity), and they recounted to him all that had happened to them.</p>

  <p>24 And they said to Joshua, "Surely the Lord has given all the land into our hands. Also, all the inhabitants of the land melt before us."
