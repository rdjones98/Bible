  <h1>Joshua (Yehoshua - YHWH is salvation) Chapter 2 - Modern English</h1>

  <p>1 Then Joshua (Yehoshua - YHWH is salvation) son of Nun (Nun - fish or posterity) secretly sent two spies from Shittim (Shittim - acacia trees), saying, "Go and explore the land, especially Jericho (Yericho - fragrance)." So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab (Rachav - broad) and stayed there.</p>

  <p>2 Someone told the king of Jericho, "Look, some men from the Israelites (Yisrael - he struggles with God) have come here tonight to spy out the land."
</p>

  <p>3 So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab (Rachav - broad): "Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land."
</p>

  <p>4 But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, "Yes, the men came to me, but I didn't know where they had come from.
</p>

  <p>5 At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, they left. I don't know where they went. Go after them quickly—you might catch up with them."
</p>

  <p>6 (But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under stalks of flax she had laid out there.)</p>

  <p>7 So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road to the fords of the Jordan (Yarden - descender), and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.</p>

  <p>8 Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof</p>

  <p>9 and said to them, "I know that the Lord (YHWH - He is) has given you this land and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this land are melting in fear because of you.</p>

  <p>10 We have heard how the Lord dried up the waters of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt (Mitzrayim - narrow places), and what you did to Sihon (Sichon - sweeping away) and Og (Og - long-necked), the two kings of the Amorites (Emori - talkers) east of the Jordan (Yarden - descender), whom you completely destroyed.</p>

  <p>11 When we heard of it, our hearts melted in fear and everyone's courage failed because of you. For the Lord your God (YHWH Eloheichem) is God (Elohim) in heaven above and on the earth below.</p>

  <p>12 Now then, please swear to me by the Lord that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign</p>

  <p>13 that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them—and that you will save us from death."
</p>

  <p>14 The men said to her, "Our lives for your lives. If you don’t tell anyone what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the Lord gives us the land."
</p>

  <p>15 So she let them down by a rope through the window, because her house was built into the city wall and she lived in the wall.</p>

  <p>16 She said to them, "Go to the hills so the pursuers won't find you. Hide there three days until they return; then go on your way."</p>

  <p>17 The men said to her, "This oath you made us swear will not be binding</p>

  <p>18 unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down. Also, bring your father, mother, brothers, and all your family into your house.</p>

  <p>19 If anyone goes outside your house into the street, their blood will be on their own head—we will not be responsible. But if anyone is with you in the house and is harmed, their blood will be on our head.</p>

  <p>20 But if you tell anyone what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear."
</p>

  <p>21 "Let it be as you say," she replied. So she sent them away, and they departed. Then she tied the scarlet cord in the window.</p>

  <p>22 When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them.</p>

  <p>23 Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, crossed the river, and came to Joshua son of Nun (Nun - fish or posterity) and told him everything that had happened to them.</p>

  <p>24 They said to Joshua, "the Lord has surely given the whole land into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us."
