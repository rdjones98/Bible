  <h1>Joshua 23</h1>
  
  <p><strong>1</strong> A long time afterward, when <strong>the Lord (YHWH - He is)</strong> had given rest to <strong>Israel (Yisra’el – God strives)</strong> from all their surrounding enemies, and <strong>Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation)</strong> was old and advanced in years,</p>

  <p><strong>2</strong> <strong>Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation)</strong> called for all <strong>Israel (Yisra’el – God strives)</strong>, their elders, their heads, their judges, and their officers, and said to them, "I am old and well advanced in years.</p>

  <p><strong>3</strong> You have seen all that the Lord your God has done to all these nations because of you, for it is the Lord your God who has fought for you.</p>

  <p><strong>4</strong> See, I have allotted to you as an inheritance for your tribes these nations that remain, along with all the nations that I have cut off, from the <strong>Jordan (Yarden – Descender)</strong> to the Great Sea in the west.</p>

  <p><strong>5</strong> the Lord your God will push them out before you and drive them out of your sight. You shall possess their land, just as the Lord your God promised you.</p>

  <p><strong>6</strong> Be very strong to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of <strong>Moses (Moshe – Drawn out)</strong>, turning aside from it neither to the right nor to the left,</p>

  <p><strong>7</strong> so that you do not mix with these nations that remain among you. Do not mention the name of their gods or swear by them, serve them, or bow down to them.</p>

  <p><strong>8</strong> But you shall hold fast to the Lord your God, as you have done to this day.</p>

  <p><strong>9</strong> For the Lord has driven out great and powerful nations before you, and no one has been able to stand before you to this day.</p>

  <p><strong>10</strong> One man of you puts a thousand to flight, because it is the Lord your God who fights for you, just as he promised you.</p>

  <p><strong>11</strong> So be very careful to love the Lord your God.</p>

  <p><strong>12</strong> For if you ever turn back and cling to the remnant of these nations that remain among you and intermarry with them and associate with them,</p>

  <p><strong>13</strong> know for certain that the Lord your God will no longer drive out these nations before you. They shall be a snare and a trap for you, a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that the Lord your God has given you.</p>

  <p><strong>14</strong> Now behold, today I am going the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls that not one word has failed of all the good things that the Lord your God promised concerning you. All have come to pass for you; not one of them has failed.</p>

  <p><strong>15</strong> But just as all the good things that the Lord your God promised concerning you have been fulfilled, so the Lord will bring upon you all the evil things, until he has destroyed you from off this good land that the Lord your God has given you,</p>

  <p><strong>16</strong> if you transgress the covenant of the Lord your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them. Then the anger of the Lord will burn against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land that he has given to you."</p>
