<h1>Joshua 8</h1>

<p><strong>1</strong> Then the Lord (YHWH – He is) said to Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation), "Do not fear or be dismayed. Take all the fighting men with you, arise, and go up to Ai (Ha'Ai – ruin). See, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho (Yericho – fragrant place) and its king. However, you may take its spoil and livestock as plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city."</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> So Joshua and all the fighting men arose to go up to Ai. Joshua chose 30,000 mighty men of valor and sent them out by night.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> He commanded them, "See, you shall lie in ambush behind the city. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> I and all the people with me will approach the city. When they come out against us as before, we shall flee before them.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> They will come out after us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, 'They are fleeing before us as before.' So we will flee before them.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> Then you shall rise from the ambush and seize the city, for the Lord (YHWH – He is) your God (Elohim – God) will give it into your hand.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> When you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do according to the word of the Lord. See, I have commanded you."</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the place of ambush, lying between Bethel (Beit-El – house of God) and Ai, to the west of Ai. But Joshua spent that night among the people.</p>

<p><strong>10</strong> Joshua rose early in the morning, mustered the people, and went up with the elders of Israel (Yisra'el – God strives) before the people to Ai.</p>

<p><strong>11</strong> All the fighting men who were with him went up and drew near before the city, encamped on the north side of Ai, with a valley between them and the city.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> He took about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Bethel (Beit-El – house of God) and Ai, to the west of the city.</p>

<p><strong>13</strong> So they stationed the forces: the main camp north of the city and the rear guard west of the city. But Joshua spent that night in the valley.</p>

<p><strong>14</strong> When the king of Ai saw this, he and his people hurried and went out early to the appointed place toward the Arabah (Aravah – desert plain) to meet Israel in battle, not knowing there was an ambush against him behind the city.</p>

<p><strong>15</strong> Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them and fled toward the wilderness.</p>

<p><strong>16</strong> All the people in the city were called together to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua, drawn away from the city.</p>

<p><strong>17</strong> Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel (Beit-El – house of God) who did not go out after Israel. They left the city open and pursued Israel.</p>

<p><strong>18</strong> Then the Lord said to Joshua, "Stretch out the javelin in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand." So Joshua stretched out the javelin in his hand toward the city.</p>

<p><strong>19</strong> The men in ambush rose quickly from their place. As he stretched out his hand, they ran, entered the city, captured it, and hurried to set the city on fire.</p>

<p><strong>20</strong> When the men of Ai looked back, they saw the smoke of the city rising to the sky. They had no power to flee this way or that, for the people who fled to the wilderness turned back against the pursuers.</p>

<p><strong>21</strong> When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city and that the smoke was rising, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.</p>

<p><strong>22</strong> The others came out from the city against them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on one side and some on the other. Israel struck them down until none remained or escaped.</p>

<p><strong>23</strong> But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.</p>

<p><strong>24</strong> When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the open wilderness where they pursued them, and all had fallen by the edge of the sword, all Israel returned to Ai and struck it down with the edge of the sword.</p>

<p><strong>25</strong> All who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand—all the people of Ai.</p>

<p><strong>26</strong> But Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had devoted all the inhabitants of Ai to destruction.</p>

<p><strong>27</strong> Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel (Yisra’el – God strives) took as their plunder, according to the word of the Lord that He had commanded Joshua.</p>

<p><strong>28</strong> So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap forever, a desolation to this day.</p>

<p><strong>29</strong> He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening. And at sunset Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised over it a great heap of stones that stands to this day.</p>

<p><strong>30</strong> Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord, the God (Elohei – God of) of Israel, on Mount Ebal (Har Eval – bald mountain),</p>

<p><strong>31</strong> just as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded the people of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: “an altar of uncut stones, on which no iron tool has been used.” And they offered on it burnt offerings to the Lord and sacrificed peace offerings.</p>

<p><strong>32</strong> And there, in the presence of the people of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written.</p>

<p><strong>33</strong> And all Israel, sojourner as well as native-born, with their elders and officers and judges, stood on either side of the ark before the Levitical (Levi – joined) priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, half of them in front of Mount Gerizim (Har Gerizim – cutting off), and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded at the first, to bless the people of Israel.</p>

<p><strong>34</strong> And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law.</p>

<p><strong>35</strong> There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women and the little ones and the sojourners who lived among them.</p>
