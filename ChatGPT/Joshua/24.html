  <h1>Joshua 24</h1>

  <p><strong>1</strong> Then <strong>Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation)</strong> gathered all the tribes of <strong>Israel (Yisra’el – God strives)</strong> to <strong>Shechem (Shekhem – Shoulder)</strong> and called for the elders of Israel, their heads, their judges, and their officers. And they presented themselves before <strong>God (Elohim – God, Mighty One)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>2</strong> Joshua said to all the people, "Thus says <strong>the Lord (YHWH – He is)</strong>, the God of Israel: 'Long ago, your ancestors—<strong>Terah (Terach – Delay)</strong>, the father of <strong>Abraham (Avraham – Father of a multitude)</strong> and <strong>Nahor (Nachor – Snorting)</strong>—lived beyond the <strong>Euphrates River (Nahar Perat – Fruitful River)</strong> and served other gods.</p>

  <p><strong>3</strong> But I took your father Abraham from beyond the river and led him throughout all the land of <strong>Canaan (Kena’an – Lowland)</strong>. I multiplied his descendants and gave him <strong>Isaac (Yitzchak – He laughs)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>4</strong> And to Isaac I gave <strong>Jacob (Ya’akov – Heel-grabber, Supplanter)</strong> and <strong>Esau (Esav – Hairy)</strong>. I gave Esau the hill country of <strong>Seir (Se’ir – Hairy or Rugged)</strong> to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to <strong>Egypt (Mitzrayim – Narrow place)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>5</strong> Then I sent <strong>Moses (Moshe – Drawn out)</strong> and <strong>Aaron (Aharon – Light-bringer or Exalted)</strong>, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in its midst. And afterward I brought you out.</p>

  <p><strong>6</strong> Then I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, and you came to the sea. The <strong>Egyptians (Mitzrim – Egyptians)</strong> pursued your ancestors with chariots and horsemen to the <strong>Red Sea (Yam Suf – Sea of Reeds)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>7</strong> When they cried out to the Lord, He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them and covered them. Your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time.</p>

  <p><strong>8</strong> I brought you to the land of the <strong>Amorites (Emori – Talkers)</strong>, who lived beyond the <strong>Jordan (Yarden – Descender)</strong>. They fought against you, but I gave them into your hand. You took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you.</p>

  <p><strong>9</strong> Then <strong>Balak (Balaq – Devastator)</strong> son of <strong>Zippor (Tzippor – Bird)</strong>, king of <strong>Moab (Mo’av – From father)</strong>, arose and fought against Israel. He sent and summoned <strong>Balaam (Bil’am – Not of the people)</strong> son of <strong>Beor (Be’or – Burning)</strong> to curse you,</p>

  <p><strong>10</strong> but I would not listen to Balaam. Indeed, he blessed you, and I delivered you out of his hand.</p>

  <p><strong>11</strong> Then you crossed over the Jordan and came to <strong>Jericho (Yericho – Fragrant)</strong>, and the leaders of Jericho fought against you—along with the Amorites, <strong>Perizzites (Perizzi – Villagers)</strong>, <strong>Canaanites (Kena’ani – Lowlanders)</strong>, <strong>Hittites (Chitti – Sons of Heth)</strong>, <strong>Girgashites (Girgashi – Clay dwellers)</strong>, <strong>Hivites (Chivi – Tent dwellers)</strong>, and <strong>Jebusites (Yevusi – Trampled ones)</strong>—but I gave them into your hand.</p>

  <p><strong>12</strong> I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out before you, the two kings of the Amorites; it was not by your sword or your bow.</p>

  <p><strong>13</strong> I gave you a land for which you did not labor, and cities you did not build, and you live in them. You eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.</p>

  <p><strong>14</strong> Now, therefore, fear the Lord and serve Him in sincerity and truth. Put away the gods that your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt, and serve the Lord.</p>

  <p><strong>15</strong> But if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served beyond the river or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."</p>

  <p><strong>16</strong> Then the people answered, "Far be it from us to forsake the Lord to serve other gods,</p>

  <p><strong>17</strong> for the Lord our God is He who brought us and our ancestors up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery, and who did those great signs before our eyes. He preserved us all along the way that we went and among all the peoples through whom we passed.</p>

  <p><strong>18</strong> And the Lord drove out before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve the Lord, for He is our God."</p>

  <p><strong>19</strong> But Joshua said to the people, "You are not able to serve the Lord, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous God. He will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.</p>

  <p><strong>20</strong> If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do you harm and consume you, after He has done you good."</p>

  <p><strong>21</strong> But the people said to Joshua, "No, we will serve the Lord."</p>

  <p><strong>22</strong> So Joshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the Lord, to serve Him." And they said, "We are witnesses."</p>

  <p><strong>23</strong> He said, "Now then, put away the foreign gods that are among you and incline your heart to the Lord, the God of Israel."</p>

  <p><strong>24</strong> And the people said to Joshua, "We will serve the Lord our God and obey His voice."</p>

  <p><strong>25</strong> So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</p>

  <p><strong>26</strong> Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. He took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord.</p>

  <p><strong>27</strong> Joshua said to all the people, "Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the Lord that He spoke to us. It shall be a witness against you, lest you deny your God."</p>

  <p><strong>28</strong> Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his inheritance.</p>

  <p><strong>29</strong> After these things, Joshua the son of <strong>Nun (Nun – Posterity)</strong>, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of 110 years.</p>

  <p><strong>30</strong> They buried him in the territory of his inheritance in <strong>Timnath-serah (Timnat Serach – Portion of abundance)</strong>, which is in the hill country of <strong>Ephraim (Efrayim – Fruitful)</strong>, north of Mount <strong>Gaash (Ga’ash – Quaking)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>31</strong> Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, and who had known all the work that the Lord had done for Israel.</p>

  <p><strong>32</strong> They buried the bones of <strong>Joseph (Yosef – He adds)</strong>, which the people of Israel had brought up from Egypt, at Shechem, in the plot of land that Jacob bought from the sons of <strong>Hamor (Chamor – Donkey)</strong>, the father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver. It became an inheritance for the descendants of <strong>Joseph (Yosef – He adds)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>33</strong> <strong>Eleazar (El’azar – God has helped)</strong> the son of Aaron died, and they buried him at <strong>Gibeah (Giv’ah – Hill)</strong>, the town of his son <strong>Phinehas (Pinchas – Dark mouth or Oracle)</strong>, which had been given to him in the hill country of <strong>Ephraim (Efrayim – Fruitful)</strong>.</p>
