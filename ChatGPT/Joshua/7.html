<h1>Joshua 7</h1>

<p><strong>1</strong> But the people of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives) were unfaithful in regard to the devoted things. Achan (Akan – troubler), son of Carmi (Karmi – my vineyard), son of Zabdi (Zavdi – my gift), son of Zerah (Zerach – sunrise), from the tribe of Judah (Yehudah – praise), took some of what was devoted to destruction. So the anger of the LORD (YHWH – He is) burned against the people of Israel.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation) sent men from Jericho (Yericho – fragrant place) to Ai (Ha’Ai – ruin), which is near Beth-aven (Beit-Aven – house of wickedness), east of Bethel (Beit-El – house of God), and said to them, “Go up and spy out the land.” So the men went up and spied out Ai.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> They returned to Joshua and said to him, “Don’t let all the people go up. Only about two or three thousand men need to go up and strike Ai. Don’t make all the people toil up there, for they are few.”</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> So about three thousand men went up there from the people, but they fled before the men of Ai.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> The men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of their men and chased them from the gate as far as Shebarim (Shevarim – breakings), and struck them down on the descent. As a result, the hearts of the people melted and became like water.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell face down to the ground before the ark of the Lord until evening, both he and the elders of Israel, and they put dust on their heads.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> Joshua said, “Oh Lord God (Adonai YHWH), why did You bring this people across the Jordan (Yarden – descender) at all, only to hand us over to the Amorites (Emori – talkers) to destroy us? If only we had been content to dwell on the other side of the Jordan (Yarden – descender)!</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> Please, Lord (Adonai – my Master), what can I say now that Israel has turned its back before its enemies?</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> The Canaanites (Kena’ani – lowlanders) and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it. They will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?”</p>

<p><strong>10</strong> The Lord said to Joshua, “Get up! Why have you fallen on your face?</p>

<p><strong>11</strong> Israel has sinned. Yes, they have violated My covenant which I commanded them. They have even taken some of the devoted things, have stolen, acted deceitfully, and put it among their own belongings.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies because they have become devoted for destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.</p>

<p><strong>13</strong> Get up! Consecrate the people and say, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow. For thus says the Lord, the God (Elohei – God of) of Israel, “There are devoted things among you, Israel. You will not be able to stand before your enemies until you remove the devoted things from among you.”</p>

<p><strong>14</strong> In the morning, you shall be brought near by your tribes. And the tribe which the Lord takes shall come near by clans. And the clan which the Lord takes shall come near by households. And the household which the Lord takes shall come near man by man.</p>

<p><strong>15</strong> And the one who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with fire—he and all that he has—because he has violated the covenant of the Lord, and has committed a disgraceful thing in Israel.”</p>

<p><strong>16</strong> So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel near by tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.</p>

<p><strong>17</strong> Then he brought near the clans of Judah, and he took the clan of the Zerahites (Zarchi – descendants of sunrise). And he brought near the clan of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi (Zavdi – my gift) was taken.</p>

<p><strong>18</strong> Then he brought near his household man by man, and Achan, son of Carmi (Karmi – my vineyard), son of Zabdi (Zavdi – my gift), son of Zerah (Zerach – sunrise), from the tribe of Judah, was taken.</p>

<p><strong>19</strong> Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the Lord (YHWH - He is), the God (Elohei) of Israel, and give Him praise. Tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me.”</p>

<p><strong>20</strong> And Achan answered Joshua, “Truly I have sinned against the Lord, the God (Elohei) of Israel, and this is what I did:</p>

<p><strong>21</strong> When I saw among the spoil a beautiful cloak from Shinar (Shin’ar – country of two rivers), two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. And behold, they are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath it.”</p>

<p><strong>22</strong> So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. And behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath it.</p>

<p><strong>23</strong> They took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the people of Israel, and they laid them out before the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>24</strong> Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan son of Zerah (Zerach – sunrise), the silver, the cloak, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his oxen, donkeys, and sheep, his tent, and all that he had, and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor (Emek Achor – valley of trouble).</p>

<p><strong>25</strong> And Joshua said, “Why have you troubled us? The Lord will trouble you this day.” Then all Israel stoned him with stones. They burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.</p>

<p><strong>26</strong> They raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Then the Lord turned from His burning anger. Therefore, the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor (Emek Achor – valley of trouble) to this day.</p>
