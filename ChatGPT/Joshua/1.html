  <h1>Joshua (Yehoshua - YHWH is salvation) Chapter 1 - Modern English</h1>

  <p>1 After the death of Moses (Moshe - drawn out) the servant of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists), the Lord spoke to Joshua (Yehoshua - YHWH is salvation) son of Nun (Nun - fish or posterity), Moses' assistant, saying:</p>

  <p>2 "Moses my servant is dead. Now then, get ready to cross the Jordan (Yarden - descender), you and all this people, into the land I am giving to the Israelites (Yisrael - he struggles with God).</p>

  <p>3 I will give you every place where you set your foot, just as I promised Moses.</p>

  <p>4 Your territory will extend from the wilderness and Lebanon (Levanon - white) to the great river, the Euphrates (Perat - fruitful), all the land of the Hittites (Chitti - terror), and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun—this will be your border.</p>

  <p>5 No one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not leave you or forsake you.</p>

  <p>6 Be strong (ḥazaq - stand firm) and courageous (ve’ematz - bold,brave,determined), because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.</p>

  <p>7 Only be strong and very courageous. Be careful to do everything according to the law that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may succeed wherever you go.</p>

  <p>8 Keep this book of the law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will prosper and succeed.</p>

  <p>9 Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord your God (YHWH Elohekha) is with you wherever you go."
</p>

  <p>10 So Joshua ordered the officers of the people:</p>

  <p>11 "Go through the camp and tell the people, 'Get your provisions ready. Three days from now you will cross the Jordan to go in and take possession of the land the Lord your God (Elohim - God) is giving you for your own.'"</p>

  <p>12 But to the Reubenites (Reuven - behold a son), the Gadites (Gad - fortune), and the half-tribe of Manasseh (Menasheh - causing to forget), Joshua said,</p>

  <p>13 "Remember the command that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you: 'the Lord your God (YHWH Eloheikhem) is giving you rest and has granted you this land.'</p>

  <p>14 Your wives, your children, and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, ready for battle, must cross over ahead of your fellow Israelites (Yisrael - he struggles with God). You are to help them</p>

  <p>15 until the Lord gives them rest, as He has done for you, and they too have taken possession of the land the Lord your God (YHWH Eloheikhem) is giving them. After that, you may return and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise."
</p>

  <p>16 Then they answered Joshua, "Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.</p>

  <p>17 Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. Only may the Lord your God (Elohim - God) be with you as He was with Moses.</p>

  <p>18 Anyone who rebels against your word and does not obey it, whatever you may command them, will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!"
