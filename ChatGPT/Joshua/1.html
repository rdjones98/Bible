  <h1>Joshua (Yehoshua - YHWH is salvation) Chapter 1</h1>

  <p>1 And it was, after the death of Moses (Mosheh - drawn out), servant of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists), that the Lord spoke to Joshua (Yehoshua - YHWH is salvation) son of Nun (Nun - fish or posterity), minister of Moses, saying:</p>

  <p>2 "Moses my servant is dead; and now, arise, cross over this Jordan (Yarden - descender), you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, to the children of Israel (Yisrael - he struggles with God)."</p>

  <p>3 "Every place that the sole of your foot treads upon, to you I have given it, as I spoke to Moses."</p>

  <p>4 "From the wilderness and this Lebanon (Levanon - whiteness) and unto the great river, the river Euphrates (Perat - fruitful), all the land of the Hittites (Chitti - descendants of Heth - terror), and unto the Great Sea toward the going of the sun shall be your border."</p>

  <p>5 "No man shall stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, I will be with you. I will not fail you and I will not forsake you."</p>

  <p>6 "Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give to them."</p>

  <p>7 "Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the Torah that Moses my servant commanded you; do not turn from it right or left, so that you may prosper wherever you go."</p>

  <p>8 "This book of the Torah shall not depart from your mouth, and you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you observe to do according to all that is written in it; for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall act wisely."</p>

  <p>9 "Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God (Elohim - God) is with you wherever you go."</p>

  <p>10 And Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</p>

  <p>11 "Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, 'Prepare provisions for yourselves, for in yet three days you are crossing this Jordan (Yarden - descender), to go in to possess the land that the Lord your God (Elohim - God) is giving you to possess.'"</p>

  <p>12 And to the Reubenites (Re'uveni - behold a son) and to the Gadites (Gadi - troop, fortune) and to the half-tribe of Manasseh (Menasheh - causing to forget), Joshua spoke, saying,</p>

  <p>13 "Remember the word that Moses, servant of the Lord, commanded you, saying, 'the Lord your God (Elohim - God) is giving you rest and is giving you this land.'"</p>

  <p>14 "Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall dwell in the land that Moses gave you beyond the Jordan (Yarden - descender), and you shall cross over armed before your brothers, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them,"</p>

  <p>15 "until the Lord gives rest to your brothers as to you, and they also possess the land that the Lord your God (Elohim - God) is giving them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession and possess it, that Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave you beyond the Jordan (Yarden - descender) toward the rising of the sun."</p>

  <p>16 And they answered Joshua, saying, "All that you command us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go."</p>

  <p>17 "According to all that we listened to Moses, so we will listen to you; only may the Lord your God (Elohim - God) be with you as He was with Moses."</p>

  <p>18 "Any man who rebels against your mouth and does not listen to your words in all that you command him shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous."</p>
