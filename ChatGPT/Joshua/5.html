<h1>Joshua 5</h1>

<p><strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites (Emori – mountain dwellers), who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites (Kena’ani – lowlanders or merchants), who were by the sea, heard how the Lord (YHWH – He is) had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives) until they had passed over, that their hearts melted, and there was no longer any spirit in them because of the children of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives).</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> At that time the Lord said to Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation), “Make flint knives for yourself and circumcise the sons of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives) again a second time.”</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> And Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth (Giv'at-ha'Aralot – hill of the foreskins).</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: All the males who came out of Egypt (Mitzrayim – narrow place), all the men of war, had died in the wilderness along the way after they came out of Egypt.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> For all the people who came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness along the way after coming out of Egypt had not been circumcised.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness until all the nation, the men of war who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not obey the voice of the Lord. The Lord swore to them that He would not let them see the land that the Lord had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> And their children, whom He raised up in their place, them Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised along the way.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> And it came to pass, when they had finished circumcising all the nation, that they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> And the Lord said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.” Therefore the name of that place is called Gilgal (Gilgal – circle of stones) to this day.</p>

<p><strong>10</strong> The children of Israel camped at Gilgal, and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening on the plains of Jericho (Yericho – fragrant place).</p>

<p><strong>11</strong> And they ate from the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover—unleavened cakes and roasted grain—on that very day.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> And the manna ceased on the next day after they had eaten from the produce of the land, and the children of Israel no longer had manna; instead, they ate from the yield of the land of Canaan (Kena’an – lowland or merchant) that year.</p>

<p><strong>13</strong> Now it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us or for our adversaries?”</p>

<p><strong>14</strong> And he said, “No, but as <a href="../Commentary/commanderofthelordsarmy.html">commander of the army of the Lord</a> I have now come.” Then Joshua fell on his face to the ground and bowed down and said to him, “What does my lord (Adonai – my lord) say to his servant?”</p>

<p><strong>15</strong> And the commander of the army of the Lord said to Joshua, “Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so.</p>
