<h1>Joshua 6</h1>

<p><strong>1</strong> Now Jericho (Yericho – fragrant place) was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives); no one went out and no one came in.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> And the Lord (YHWH – He is) said to Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation), “See, I have given Jericho (Yericho – fragrant place) into your hand, along with its king and mighty warriors.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> You shall march around the city, all the men of war going around the city once. You shall do this for six days.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> And when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up, every man straight ahead.”</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> So Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation) the son of Nun (Nun – fish or posterity) called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the Lord.”</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> And he said to the people, “Pass on, and march around the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the Lord.”</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> And it came to pass, when Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation) had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns passed on before the Lord and blew the trumpets, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while the trumpets sounded continually.</p>

<p><strong>10</strong> But Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation) commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout or make your voice heard, neither shall any word go out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout!”</p>

<p><strong>11</strong> So he caused the ark of the Lord to circle the city, going around it once. Then they came into the camp and stayed there overnight.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation) rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>13</strong> And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the Lord went on continually and blew the trumpets, and the armed men went before them, and the rear guard followed the ark of the Lord, while the trumpets blew continually.</p>

<p><strong>14</strong> And the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.</p>

<p><strong>15</strong> On the seventh day they rose early, at the break of dawn, and marched around the city in the same manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times.</p>

<p><strong>16</strong> And on the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation) said to the people, “Shout! For the Lord has given you the city.</p>

<p><strong>17</strong> And the city and all that is in it shall be devoted to the Lord for destruction. Only Rahab (Rachav – broad) the prostitute, and all who are with her in the house, shall live, because she hid the messengers we sent.</p>

<p><strong>18</strong> But you, keep away from the devoted things, lest you take any of them and make the camp of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives) a thing for destruction and bring trouble upon it.</p>

<p><strong>19</strong> But all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are holy to the Lord; they shall go into the treasury of the Lord.”</p>

<p><strong>20</strong> So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets. When the people heard the sound of the trumpet, they shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat. So the people went up into the city, every man straight ahead, and they captured the city.</p>

<p><strong>21</strong> Then they devoted all in the city to destruction, both men and women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys, with the edge of the sword.</p>

<p><strong>22</strong> But Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation) said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the house of the woman, the prostitute, and bring her out from there, along with all who belong to her, as you swore to her.”</p>

<p><strong>23</strong> So the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab (Rachav – broad), and her father, her mother, her brothers, and all who belonged to her. They brought out all her relatives and set them outside the camp of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives).</p>

<p><strong>24</strong> Then they burned the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver, the gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>25</strong> But Rahab (Rachav – broad) the prostitute, her father's household, and all who belonged to her, Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation) spared. And she lives in the midst of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives) to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation) sent to spy out Jericho (Yericho – fragrant place).</p>

<p><strong>26</strong> And Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation) laid an oath on them at that time, saying, “Cursed before the Lord is the man who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho (Yericho – fragrant place). At the cost of his firstborn he shall lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest he shall set up its gates.”</p>

<p><strong>27</strong> So the Lord was with Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation), and his fame spread throughout all the land.</p>
