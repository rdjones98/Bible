  <h1>Deuteronomy 34</h1>

  <p><strong>1</strong> Then Moses (Drawn out) went up from the plains of Moab (From father) to Mount Nebo (The prophet), to the top of Pisgah (Lookout), across from Jericho (City of the moon). And the LORD (YHWH) showed him the whole land—from Gilead (Eternal) to Dan (Judge),</p>
  <p><strong>2</strong> all of Naphtali (My wrestling), the territory of Ephraim (Fruitful) and Manasseh (Causing to forget), all the land of Judah (Praise), as far as the Mediterranean Sea (Sea of the west),</p>
  <p><strong>3</strong> the Negev (South) and the whole region from the valley of Jericho (City of the moon), the city of palms, as far as Zoar (Small). </p>
  <p><strong>4</strong> Then the LORD said to him, “This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham (Father of many), Isaac (Laughter) and Jacob (Supplanter) when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over into it.”</p>
  <p><strong>5</strong> And Moses the servant of the LORD died there in Moab (From father) as the LORD had said.</p>
  <p><strong>6</strong> He buried him in Moab (From father), in the valley opposite Beth Peor (House of the opening), but to this day no one knows where his grave is.</p>
  <p><strong>7</strong> Moses was 120 years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone.</p>
  <p><strong>8</strong> The Israelites (God prevails) grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab (From father) thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning was over.</p>
  <p><strong>9</strong> Now Joshua (YHWH is salvation) son of Nun (Fish) was filled with the <a href="../Commentary/Names of Holy Spirit.html">spirit of wisdom (ruach chokmah)</a> because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites (God prevails) listened to him and did as the LORD had commanded Moses.</p>
  <p><strong>10</strong> Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel (God prevails) like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,</p>
  <p><strong>11</strong> who did all those signs and wonders the LORD sent him to do in Egypt (House of bondage), to Pharaoh (Great house) and to all his officials and to his whole land.</p>
  <p><strong>12</strong> For no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel (God prevails).</p>
