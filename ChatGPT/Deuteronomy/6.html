    <h1>Deuteronomy 6</h1>
    <p><strong>1.</strong> And this is the commandment, the statutes, and the judgments that the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) commanded to teach you, to do in the land where you are passing over there to possess it,</p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> So that you may fear the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones), to keep all His statutes and His commandments that I am commanding you—you and your son and your son’s son—all the days of your life, and so that your days may be prolonged.</p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> And you shall hear, Israel (God Strives), and you shall be careful to do, that it may be well with you, and that you may multiply greatly, as the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists), God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) of your fathers, has spoken to you—a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
    <p><strong>4.</strong> Hear, Israel (God Strives), the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) our God (Elohim, Mighty Ones), the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) is one.</p>
    <p><strong>5.</strong> And you shall love the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.</p>
    <p><strong>6.</strong> And these words that I am commanding you today shall be on your heart.</p>
    <p><strong>7.</strong> And you shall teach them diligently to your sons, and you shall speak of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk on the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.</p>
    <p><strong>8.</strong> And you shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.</p>
    <p><strong>9.</strong> And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.</p>
    <p><strong>10.</strong> And it shall be, when the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) brings you to the land that He swore to your fathers—to Abraham (Father of a Multitude), to Isaac (He Laughs), and to Jacob (Heel Holder)—to give you great and good cities that you did not build,</p>
    <p><strong>11.</strong> And houses full of all good things that you did not fill, and wells dug that you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant—and you eat and are satisfied,</p>
    <p><strong>12.</strong> Then beware lest you forget the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists), who brought you out of the land of Egypt (Narrow Place), out of the house of bondage.</p>
    <p><strong>13.</strong> the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) you shall fear, and Him you shall serve, and by His name you shall swear.</p>
    <p><strong>14.</strong> You shall not go after other gods (eloheihem, their gods), of the gods of the peoples who are around you.</p>
    <p><strong>15.</strong> For the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) in your midst is a jealous God (El, Mighty One); lest the anger of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) burn against you, and He destroy you from the face of the ground.</p>
    <p><strong>16.</strong> You shall not test the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) as you tested Him at Massah (Testing).</p>
    <p><strong>17.</strong> You shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones), and His testimonies, and His statutes that He has commanded you.</p>
    <p><strong>18.</strong> And you shall do what is right and good in the eyes of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists), so that it may be well with you, and you may go in and possess the good land that the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) swore to your fathers,</p>
    <p><strong>19.</strong> To drive out all your enemies from before you, as the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) has spoken.</p>
    <p><strong>20.</strong> When your son asks you in the future, saying, ‘What are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments that the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) our God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) commanded you?’</p>
    <p><strong>21.</strong> Then you shall say to your son, ‘We were slaves to Pharaoh (Great House) in Egypt (Narrow Place), and the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) brought us out of Egypt (Narrow Place) with a strong hand.</p>
    <p><strong>22.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) gave signs and wonders, great and evil, upon Egypt (Narrow Place), upon Pharaoh (Great House), and upon all his house, before our eyes.</p>
    <p><strong>23.</strong> And He brought us out from there to bring us in, to give us the land that He swore to our fathers.</p>
    <p><strong>24.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) our God (Elohim, Mighty Ones), for our good always, to keep us alive, as it is today.</p>
    <p><strong>25.</strong> And it will be righteousness for us if we are careful to do all this commandment before the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) our God (Elohim, Mighty Ones), as He has commanded us.’</p>
