    <h1>Deuteronomy 1</h1>
    <p>1 These are the words which Moses (Drawn Out) spoke to all Israel (God Strives) across the Jordan (Descender) in the wilderness, in the Arabah (Desert Plain) opposite Suph (Reeds), between Paran (Cavern) and Tophel (White) and Laban (White) and Hazeroth (Villages) and Di-Zahab (Abounding in Gold).</p>
    <p>2 Eleven days from Horeb (Desert) by way of Mount Seir (Rough) to Kadesh-Barnea (Holy-Purifier).</p>

    <p>3 And it was in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, Moses spoke to the sons of Israel (God Strives) according to all that the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) had commanded him to them,</p>
    <p>4 after he had struck Sihon (Sweeping Away) king of the Amorites (Talkers), who dwelt in Heshbon (Stronghold), and Og (Long-Necked) king of Bashan (Fruitful), who dwelt in Ashtaroth (Star) in Edrei (Mighty).</p>
    <p>5 Across the Jordan (Descender) in the land of Moab (From Father), Moses began to explain this law, saying,</p>
    <p>6 "the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) our God spoke to us in Horeb (Desert), saying, 'You have dwelt long enough in this mountain.</p>
    <p>7 Turn and journey, and go to the mountain of the Amorites (Talkers) and to all its neighbors, in the Arabah (Desert Plain), in the mountain, and in the lowland, and in the south, and by the seashore, the land of the Canaanites (Lowlanders), and Lebanon (White), as far as the great river, the river Euphrates (Fruitful).</p>
    <p>8 See, I have set before you the land; go in and possess the land which the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) swore to your fathers, to Abraham (Father of a Multitude), to Isaac (He Laughs), and to Jacob (He Grasps the Heel), to give to them and to their seed after them.'</p>
    <p>9 And I spoke to you at that time, saying, 'I am not able to bear you alone.</p>
    <p>10 the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as the stars of the heavens for multitude.</p>
    <p>11 May the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists), the God of your fathers, add to you a thousand times more than you are, and bless you as He has spoken to you!</p>
    <p>12 How can I alone bear your burden and your load and your strife?</p>
    <p>13 Provide for yourselves wise and understanding and known men, according to your tribes, and I will set them as your heads.'</p>
    <p>14 And you answered me and said, 'The thing which you have spoken is good to do.'</p>
    <p>15 So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and known men, and set them as heads over you, leaders of thousands and leaders of hundreds and leaders of fifties and leaders of tens, and officers for your tribes.</p>
    <p>16 And I commanded your judges at that time, saying, 'Hear between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother and the stranger with him.</p>
    <p>17 You shall not recognize faces in judgment; the small as the great you shall hear; you shall not be afraid of any man, for the judgment is God's (He Exists). And the matter that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I shall hear it.'</p>
    <p>18 And I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.</p>
    <p>19 And we journeyed from Horeb (Desert) and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, on the way to the mountain of the Amorites (Talkers), as the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) our God commanded us, and we came to Kadesh-Barnea (Holy-Purifier).</p>
    <p>20 And I said to you, 'You have come to the mountain of the Amorites (Talkers), which the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) our God is giving to us.</p>
    <p>21 See, the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God has set before you the land; go up, possess it, as the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) the God of your fathers has spoken to you; do not fear, nor be dismayed.'</p>
    <p>22 And you all came near to me and said, 'Let us send men before us, and they shall search out the land and bring back word to us of the way by which we should go up, and the cities into which we shall come.'</p>
    <p>23 And the thing was good in my eyes, so I took twelve men from you, one man for each tribe.</p>
    <p>24 And they turned and went up to the mountain and came to the Valley of Eshcol (Cluster) and spied it out.</p>
    <p>25 And they took in their hands some of the fruit of the land and brought it down to us, and they brought back word and said, 'The land which the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) our God is giving us is good.'</p>
    <p>26 But you were not willing to go up, and you rebelled against the mouth of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God.</p>
    <p>27 And you murmured in your tents and said, 'Because the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) hated us, He brought us out of the land of Egypt (Double Straits) to give us into the hand of the Amorites (Talkers) to destroy us.</p>
    <p>28 Where shall we go up? Our brothers have melted our hearts, saying, "A people greater and taller than we, cities great and fortified to the heavens, and moreover, we have seen the sons of the Anakim (Long-Necked) there."'</p>
    <p>29 And I said to you, 'Do not be terrified nor be afraid of them.</p>
    <p>30 the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God, who goes before you, He will fight for you, according to all that He did for you in Egypt (Double Straits) before your eyes,</p>
    <p>31 and in the wilderness, where you have seen how the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went until you came to this place.'</p>
    <p>32 Yet in this thing you did not believe the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God,</p>
    <p>33 who went before you in the way, to search out a place for you to pitch your tents, in fire by night to show you the way you should go, and in cloud by day.</p>
    <p>34 And the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) heard the voice of your words and was angry and swore, saying,</p>
    <p>35 'Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land which I swore to give to your fathers,</p>
    <p>36 except Caleb (Dog) son of Jephunneh (He Will Be Prepared); he shall see it, and to him I shall give the land where he has trodden, and to his sons, because he wholly followed the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists).'</p>
