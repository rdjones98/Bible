    <h1>Deuteronomy 7</h1>
    <p><strong>1.</strong> And when the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) brings you to the land where you are coming there to possess it, and He clears away many nations from before you—the Hittite (Terror), and the Girgashite (Dwelling on Clay), and the Amorite (Talker), and the Canaanite (Lowlander), and the Perizzite (Unwalled Villager), and the Hivite (Villager), and the Jebusite (Trampler)—seven nations greater and mightier than you,</p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) gives them before you, and you strike them—you shall devote them to destruction; you shall not make a covenant with them, and you shall not show them favor.</p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> And you shall not intermarry with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, and his daughter you shall not take for your son.</p>
    <p><strong>4.</strong> For they will turn your son away from following Me, and they will serve other gods (elohim, mighty ones); and the anger of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) will burn against you, and He will destroy you quickly.</p>
    <p><strong>5.</strong> But thus you shall do to them: their altars you shall break down, and their pillars you shall shatter, and their Asherim (Sacred Trees) you shall cut down, and their carved images you shall burn with fire.</p>
    <p><strong>6.</strong> For a holy people you are to the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones); the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) has chosen you to be for Him a treasured people from all the peoples that are on the face of the ground.</p>
    <p><strong>7.</strong> Not because of your being more numerous than all the peoples has the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) desired you and chosen you, for you are the fewest of all the peoples.</p>
    <p><strong>8.</strong> But because of Yahweh’s (He Who Exists) love for you, and because of His keeping the oath that He swore to your fathers, the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) brought you out with a strong hand and redeemed you from the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh (Great House), king of Egypt (Narrow Place).</p>
    <p><strong>9.</strong> And you shall know that the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones), He is God (Elohim, Mighty Ones), the faithful God (El, Mighty One), keeping the covenant and the loving-kindness to those who love Him and to those who keep His commandments, to a thousand generations,</p>
    <p><strong>10.</strong> But repaying those who hate Him to their face, to destroy them; He will not delay to him who hates Him—to his face He will repay him.</p>
    <p><strong>11.</strong> And you shall keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the judgments that I command you today, to do them.</p>
    <p><strong>12.</strong> And it shall be, because you hear these judgments and keep and do them, then the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) will keep for you the covenant and the loving-kindness that He swore to your fathers.</p>
    <p><strong>13.</strong> And He will love you and bless you and multiply you; and He will bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your wine and your oil, the increase of your cattle and the young of your flock, in the land that He swore to your fathers to give you.</p>
    <p><strong>14.</strong> Blessed shall you be above all peoples; there shall not be among you a barren man or a barren woman, nor among your livestock.</p>
    <p><strong>15.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) will turn away from you all sickness, and none of the evil diseases of Egypt (Narrow Place), which you have known, will He put on you, but He will lay them on all who hate you.</p>
    <p><strong>16.</strong> And you shall consume all the peoples whom the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) gives to you; your eye shall not pity them, and you shall not serve their gods (elohim, mighty ones), for it will be a snare to you.</p>
    <p><strong>17.</strong> If you say in your heart, ‘These nations are greater than I; how can I dispossess them?’</p>
    <p><strong>18.</strong> You shall not fear them; you shall remember what the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) did to Pharaoh (Great House) and to all Egypt (Narrow Place),</p>
    <p><strong>19.</strong> The great trials that your eyes saw, and the signs and the wonders, and the strong hand and the outstretched arm by which the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) brought you out—so will the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.</p>
    <p><strong>20.</strong> And also the hornet the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) will send among them, until those who are left and who hide themselves from your face perish.</p>
    <p><strong>21.</strong> You shall not be terrified of them, for the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) is in your midst, a great and awesome God (El, Mighty One).</p>
    <p><strong>22.</strong> And the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) will clear away these nations from before you little by little; you shall not consume them quickly, lest the beasts of the field multiply against you.</p>
    <p><strong>23.</strong> But the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones) will give them over to you and throw them into great confusion until they are destroyed.</p>
    <p><strong>24.</strong> And He will give their kings into your hand, and you shall destroy their name from under the heavens; no man shall stand before you until you have destroyed them.</p>
    <p><strong>25.</strong> The carved images of their gods (eloheihem, their gods) you shall burn with fire; you shall not covet the silver or the gold on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared by it, for it is an abomination to the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim, Mighty Ones).</p>
    <p><strong>26.</strong> And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, lest you be devoted to destruction like it; you shall utterly detest it and utterly abhor it, for it is devoted to destruction.</p>
