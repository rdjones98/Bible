    <h1>Deuteronomy 31 - Literal Translation</h1>
    <p>1 And Moses (drawn out) went and spoke these words to all Israel (God Strives).</p>
    <p>2 And he said to them, "I am a hundred and twenty years old today; I am no longer able to go out and come in, and the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) has said to me, 'You shall not cross over this Jordan (Descender).'</p>
    <p>3 The Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim - Mighty Ones), He is crossing over before you; He will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua (YHWH is Salvation), he is crossing over before you, as the Lord has spoken.</p>
    <p>4 And the Lord will do to them as He did to Sihon (Sweeping Away) and to Og (Long-Necked), kings of the Amorites (Hill Dwellers), and to their land, when He destroyed them.</p>
    <p>5 And the Lord will give them before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you.</p>
    <p>6 Be strong and courageous; do not fear nor be afraid of them, for the Lord your God, He is the One who goes with you; He will not fail you nor forsake you."</p>
    <p>7 And Moses called to Joshua (YHWH is Salvation) and said to him before the eyes of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people to the land which the Lord has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall cause them to inherit it.</p>
    <p>8 And the Lord, He is the One who goes before you; He will be with you; He will not fail you nor forsake you. Do not fear nor be dismayed."</p>
    <p>9 And Moses wrote this Torah and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi (Joined), who carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel.</p>
    <p>10 And Moses commanded them, saying, "At the end of seven years, in the appointed time of the year of release, in the Feast of Booths,</p>
    <p>11 When all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place which He chooses, you shall read this Torah before all Israel in their ears.</p>
    <p>12 Gather the people, the men, and the women, and the little ones, and your sojourner who is within your gates, so that they may hear and so that they may learn and fear the Lord your God, and observe to do all the words of this Torah.</p>
    <p>13 And their children who have not known, they shall hear and learn to fear the Lord your God all the days that you live on the land which you are crossing over the Jordan (Descender) to possess."</p>
    <p>14 And the Lord said to Moses, "Behold, your days approach to die; call Joshua (YHWH is Salvation), and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, so that I may command him." And Moses and Joshua (YHWH is Salvation) went and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.</p>
    <p>15 And the Lord appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood at the entrance of the Tent.</p>
    <p>16 And the Lord said to Moses, "Behold, you are about to lie down with your fathers, and this people will rise and whore after the foreign gods of the land where they are going to be among them, and they will forsake Me and break My covenant which I have made with them.</p>
    <p>17 And My anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall find them, and they shall say in that day, 'Is it not because our God is not among us that these evils have found us?'</p>
    <p>18 But I will surely hide My face in that day for all the evil which they have done, for they have turned to other gods.</p>
    <p>19 And now, write for yourselves this song and teach it to the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, so that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel.</p>
    <p>20 For I will bring them to the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they will eat and be satisfied and grow fat, and they will turn to other gods and serve them and provoke Me and break My covenant.</p>
    <p>21 And it shall be, when many evils and troubles have found them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness, for it shall not be forgotten from the mouths of their seed, for I know their inclination, what they are making today, before I bring them into the land which I swore."</p>
    <p>22 And Moses wrote this song in that day and taught it to the children of Israel.</p>
    <p>23 And He commanded Joshua (YHWH is Salvation) the son of Nun (Perpetuity) and said, "Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them, and I will be with you."</p>
    <p>24 And it was, when Moses finished writing the words of this Torah in a book until they were completed,</p>
    <p>25 That Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying,</p>
    <p>26 "Take this book of the Torah and put it at the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and it shall be there as a witness against you.</p>
    <p>27 For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck; behold, while I am still alive with you today, you have been rebellious against the Lord, and how much more after my death?</p>
    <p>28 Gather to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, and I will speak these words in their ears and call the heavens and the earth to witness against them.</p>
    <p>29 For I know that after my death you will surely act corruptly and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you, and evil will befall you in the latter days, because you will do what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands."</p>
    <p>30 And Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song until they were completed.</p>
    <p>31 And Moses continued to speak all these words to all Israel.</p>
