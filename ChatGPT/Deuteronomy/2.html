    <h1>Deuteronomy 2</h1>
    <p>1 And we turned and journeyed into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, as the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) spoke to me, and we circled Mount Seir (Rough) many days.</p>
    <p>2 And the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) spoke to me, saying,</p>
    <p>3 'You have circled this mountain long enough; turn northward.</p>
    <p>4 And command the people, saying, "You are passing through the border of your brothers, the sons of Esau (Hairy), who dwell in Seir (Rough), and they will be afraid of you, so be very careful.</p>
    <p>5 Do not contend with them, for I will not give you of their land, not even a footstep, because I have given Mount Seir (Rough) to Esau (Hairy) as a possession.</p>
    <p>6 You shall buy food from them with silver, so that you may eat, and you shall also purchase water from them with silver, so that you may drink.</p>
    <p>7 For the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands; He has known your walking through this great wilderness these forty years; the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing."'</p>
    <p>8 And we passed by from our brothers, the sons of Esau (Hairy), who dwell in Seir (Rough), from the way of the Arabah (Desert Plain), from Elath (Grove of Trees) and from Ezion-Geber (Backbone of a Man), and we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab (From Father).</p>
    <p>9 And the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) said to me, "Do not distress Moab (From Father), and do not contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar (City) to the sons of Lot (Covering) as a possession."</p>
    <p>10 (The Emim (Terrifying Ones) dwelt there before, a people great and many and tall as the Anakim (Long-Necked).</p>
    <p>11 They were also considered Rephaim (Giants), like the Anakim (Long-Necked), but the Moabites (From Father) call them Emim (Terrifying Ones).</p>
    <p>12 And in Seir (Rough) dwelt the Horites (Cave Dwellers) before, but the sons of Esau (Hairy) dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and dwelt in their place, as Israel (God Strives) did to the land of his possession, which the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) gave to them.)</p>
    <p>13 'Now rise and cross over the brook Zered (Osier Brook).' And we crossed over the brook Zered (Osier Brook).</p>
    <p>14 And the days in which we went from Kadesh-Barnea (Holy-Purifier) until we crossed over the brook Zered (Osier Brook) were thirty-eight years, until the entire generation of the men of war had perished from the midst of the camp, as the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) had sworn to them.</p>
    <p>15 Also the hand of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.</p>
    <p>16 And it was, when all the men of war had perished from among the people,</p>
    <p>17 the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) spoke to me, saying,</p>
    <p>18 'Today you are passing over the border of Moab (From Father), at Ar (City).</p>
    <p>19 And you shall approach the sons of Ammon (People), but do not distress them nor contend with them, for I will not give to you of the land of the sons of Ammon (People) any possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot (Covering) as a possession.'</p>
    <p>20 (It was also considered the land of Rephaim (Giants); the Rephaim (Giants) dwelt in it before, and the Ammonites (People) call them Zamzummim (Murmurers),</p>
    <p>21 a people great and many and tall as the Anakim (Long-Necked), but the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) destroyed them from before them, and they dispossessed them and dwelt in their place,</p>
    <p>22 as He did for the sons of Esau (Hairy), who dwell in Seir (Rough), when He destroyed the Horites (Cave Dwellers) from before them, and they dispossessed them and dwelt in their place to this day.</p>
    <p>23 And the Avvim (Ruin Dwellers), who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza (Strong), the Caphtorim (From Crete), who came out from Caphtor (Crete), destroyed them and dwelt in their place.)</p>
    <p>24 'Rise up, journey, and cross over the Valley of Arnon (Rushing Stream). See, I have given into your hand Sihon (Sweeping Away) the Amorite (Talker), king of Heshbon (Stronghold), and his land; begin to possess it and contend with him in battle.</p>
    <p>25 This day I begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples under all the heavens, who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.'</p>
    <p>26 And I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth (Eastern Parts) to Sihon (Sweeping Away) king of Heshbon (Stronghold) with words of peace, saying,</p>
    <p>27 'Let me pass through your land; I will go by the road, I will not turn aside to the right or to the left.</p>
    <p>28 You shall sell me food for silver, that I may eat, and give me water for silver, that I may drink; only let me pass through on foot,</p>
    <p>29 as the sons of Esau (Hairy), who dwell in Seir (Rough), and the Moabites (From Father), who dwell in Ar (City), did for me, until I cross over the Jordan (Descender) to the land that the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) our God is giving to us.'</p>
    <p>30 But Sihon (Sweeping Away) king of Heshbon (Stronghold) was not willing to let us pass through, for the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God hardened his spirit and strengthened his heart, to give him into your hand as this day.</p>
    <p>31 And the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) said to me, 'See, I have begun to give before you Sihon (Sweeping Away) and his land; begin to possess it, to inherit his land.'</p>
    <p>32 And Sihon (Sweeping Away) came out to meet us, he and all his people, for battle at Jahaz (Trampled Place).</p>
    <p>33 And the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) our God gave him before us, and we struck him and his sons and all his people.</p>
    <p>34 And we took all his cities at that time and devoted every city, men and women and little ones; we left no survivor.</p>
    <p>35 Only the cattle we took as plunder for ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we had taken.</p>
    <p>36 From Aroer (Bare) which is on the edge of the Valley of Arnon (Rushing Stream), and the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead (Rocky Region), there was no city too high for us; the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) our God gave all before us.</p>
    <p>37 Only to the land of the sons of Ammon (People) you did not come, to all the side of the River Jabbok (Pouring Out), nor to the cities of the mountain, nor to all which the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) our God had commanded us.</p>
