    <h1>Deuteronomy 9</h1>
    <p><strong>1:</strong> Hear, O Israel, you are passing over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, cities great and fortified up to the heavens,</p>
    <p><strong>2:</strong> a people great and tall, the sons of Anak (Anak: Long-Necked), whom you know, and of whom you have heard it said, "Who can stand before the sons of Anak?"</p>
    <p><strong>3:</strong> And you shall know today that the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim: Mighty Ones) is He who passes over before you as a consuming fire. He shall destroy them, and He shall subdue them before you, and you shall dispossess them and destroy them quickly, as the Lord has spoken to you.</p>
    <p><strong>4:</strong> Do not say in your heart, when the Lord your God has thrust them out from before you, "Because of my righteousness the Lord has brought me in to possess this land." But because of the wickedness of these nations the Lord is driving them out from before you.</p>
    <p><strong>5:</strong> Not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart are you going in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations the Lord your God is driving them out from before you, and to confirm the word that the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham (Abraham: Father of a Multitude), to Isaac (Isaac: He Laughs), and to Jacob (Jacob: Supplanter).</p>
    <p><strong>6:</strong> And you shall know that not because of your righteousness the Lord your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people.</p>
    <p><strong>7:</strong> Remember, do not forget how you provoked the Lord your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day you went out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the Lord.</p>
    <p><strong>8:</strong> And at Horeb you provoked the Lord to wrath, and the Lord was angry with you to destroy you.</p>
    <p><strong>9:</strong> When I went up into the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the Lord made with you, then I stayed in the mountain forty days and forty nights; I did not eat bread and I did not drink water.</p>
    <p><strong>10:</strong> And the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them was according to all the words that the Lord spoke with you in the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</p>
    <p><strong>11:</strong> And it came to pass, at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.</p>
    <p><strong>12:</strong> And the Lord said to me, "Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned aside from the way that I commanded them; they have made a molten image for themselves."</p>
    <p><strong>13:</strong> And the Lord spoke to me, saying, "I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.</p>
    <p><strong>14:</strong> Let Me alone, and I will destroy them and blot out their name from under the heavens, and I will make you a nation mightier and greater than they."</p>
    <p><strong>15:</strong> So I turned and went down from the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.</p>
    <p><strong>16:</strong> And I saw, and behold, you had sinned against the Lord your God; you had made for yourselves a molten calf; you had quickly turned aside from the way that the Lord had commanded you.</p>
    <p><strong>17:</strong> And I took hold of the two tablets and cast them out of my two hands, and I broke them before your eyes.</p>
    <p><strong>18:</strong> And I fell down before the Lord, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did not eat bread and I did not drink water, because of all your sin that you had sinned, in doing evil in the eyes of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger.</p>
    <p><strong>19:</strong> For I was afraid of the anger and wrath with which the Lord was angry against you to destroy you. But the Lord listened to me at that time also.</p>
    <p><strong>20:</strong> And against Aaron (Aaron: Light-Bringer) the Lord was very angry to destroy him, and I prayed for Aaron also at that time.</p>
    <p><strong>21:</strong> And I took your sin, the calf that you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it thoroughly until it was as fine as dust, and I cast its dust into the brook that descended from the mountain.</p>
    <p><strong>22:</strong> And at Taberah (Taberah: Burning), and at Massah (Massah: Testing), and at Kibroth-hattaavah (Kibroth-hattaavah: Graves of Lust), you provoked the Lord to wrath.</p>
    <p><strong>23:</strong> And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea (Kadesh-barnea: Holy Place of Wandering), saying, "Go up and possess the land that I have given you," then you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God, and you did not believe Him, nor did you listen to His voice.</p>
    <p><strong>24:</strong> You have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you.</p>
    <p><strong>25:</strong> And I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights, as I had done before, because the Lord had said He would destroy you.</p>
    <p><strong>26:</strong> And I prayed to the Lord, and said, "O Lord the Lord, do not destroy Your people and Your inheritance, whom You have redeemed in Your greatness, whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</p>
    <p><strong>27:</strong> Remember Your servants, Abraham (Abraham: Father of a Multitude), Isaac (Isaac: He Laughs), and Jacob (Jacob: Supplanter); do not look at the stubbornness of this people, or at their wickedness, or at their sin,</p>
    <p><strong>28:</strong> lest the land from which You brought us say, "Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land that He promised them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness."</p>
    <p><strong>29:</strong> But they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You brought out by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm."</p>
