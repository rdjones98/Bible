    <h1>Deuteronomy 8</h1>
    <p><strong>1:</strong> All the commandment that I command you today you shall keep to do, so that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land that the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) swore to your fathers.</p>
    <p><strong>2:</strong> And you shall remember all the way that the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim: Mighty Ones) led you these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you, to test you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.</p>
    <p><strong>3:</strong> And He humbled you and let you hunger, and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, so that He might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) man lives.</p>
    <p><strong>4:</strong> Your clothing did not wear out upon you, nor did your foot swell these forty years.</p>
    <p><strong>5:</strong> And you shall know in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim: Mighty Ones) disciplines you.</p>
    <p><strong>6:</strong> And you shall keep the commandments of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim: Mighty Ones), to walk in His ways and to fear Him.</p>
    <p><strong>7:</strong> For the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim: Mighty Ones) is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths springing out in valleys and hills,</p>
    <p><strong>8:</strong> a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey,</p>
    <p><strong>9:</strong> a land where you shall eat bread without scarcity, you shall not lack anything in it, a land whose stones are iron, and from whose hills you may dig copper.</p>
    <p><strong>10:</strong> And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim: Mighty Ones) for the good land that He has given you.</p>
    <p><strong>11:</strong> Beware lest you forget the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim: Mighty Ones) by not keeping His commandments, and His judgments, and His statutes, which I command you today,</p>
    <p><strong>12:</strong> lest when you have eaten and are satisfied, and have built good houses and dwelt in them,</p>
    <p><strong>13:</strong> and your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied,</p>
    <p><strong>14:</strong> then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim: Mighty Ones), who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery,</p>
    <p><strong>15:</strong> who led you through the great and fearful wilderness, with fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water, who brought forth water for you out of the rock of flint,</p>
    <p><strong>16:</strong> who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers did not know, to humble you and to test you, to do good to you in the endâ€”</p>
    <p><strong>17:</strong> and you say in your heart, "My power and the might of my hand have made me this wealth."</p>
    <p><strong>18:</strong> But you shall remember the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim: Mighty Ones), for it is He who gives you power to make wealth, that He may establish His covenant that He swore to your fathers, as it is this day.</p>
    <p><strong>19:</strong> And it shall be, if you forget the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim: Mighty Ones), and walk after other gods and serve them and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you shall surely perish.</p>
    <p><strong>20:</strong> Like the nations that the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) makes to perish before you, so you shall perish, because you would not listen to the voice of the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim: Mighty Ones).</p>
