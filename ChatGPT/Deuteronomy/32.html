  <h1>Deuteronomy 32</h1>

  <p><strong>1</strong> Listen, O heavens, and I will speak; hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.</p>
  <p><strong>2</strong> Let my teaching drop as the rain, my speech distill as the dew, as the gentle rain on the grass, and as the showers on the plants.</p>
  <p><strong>3</strong> I will proclaim the name of the LORD (YHWH); ascribe greatness to our God (Elohim).</p>
  <p><strong>4</strong> He is the Rock; his work is perfect, for all his ways are just. A faithful God (Elohim) who does no wrong, upright and just is he.</p>
  <p><strong>5</strong> They are corrupt and not his children; they are a perverse and crooked generation.</p>
  <p><strong>6</strong> Is this the way you repay the LORD (YHWH), you foolish and unwise people? Is he not your Father, who created you, who made you and established you?</p>
  <p><strong>7</strong> Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations; ask your father, and he will show you, your elders, and they will tell you.</p>
  <p><strong>8</strong> When the <a href="../Commentary/Names of God.html">Most High (Elyon)</a> gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided mankind, he set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel (God prevails).</p>
  <p><strong>9</strong> For the LORD’s (YHWH) portion is his people, Jacob (Supplanter) is the lot of his inheritance.</p>
  <p><strong>10</strong> He found him in a desert land, and in the wasteland, a howling wilderness; he surrounded him, cared for him, and guarded him as the apple of his eye.</p>
  <p><strong>11</strong> As an eagle stirs up its nest, hovers over its young, spreads its wings, takes them, and carries them on its pinions,</p>
  <p><strong>12</strong> the LORD (YHWH) alone led him, and there was no foreign god (elohim) with him.</p>
  <p><strong>13</strong> He made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him with the fruit of the fields. He nourished him with honey from the rock and with oil from the flinty rock,</p>
  <p><strong>14</strong> with curds from the herd and milk from the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of Bashan (Fruitful), and goats, with the finest wheat; and you drank the pure blood of the grape.</p>
  <p><strong>15</strong> But Jeshurun (The Upright) grew fat and kicked; you grew fat, you grew thick, you were covered with fat. Then he forsook God (Elohim) who made him and rejected the Rock of his salvation.</p>
  <p><strong>16</strong> They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods (elohim), with abominations they provoked him to anger.</p>
  <p><strong>17</strong> They sacrificed to demons, not to God (Elohim), to gods they had not known, to new gods that came up recently, whom your ancestors did not fear.</p>
  <p><strong>18</strong> You were unmindful of the Rock (Tsur) who gave you birth, and you forgot the God (Elohim) who formed you.</p>
  <p><strong>19</strong> When the LORD (YHWH) saw it, he was angry; he rejected his sons and daughters.</p>
  <p><strong>20</strong> He said, “I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end will be, for they are a perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness.”</p>
  <p><strong>21</strong> They have made me jealous with what is not God (Elohim); they have provoked me to anger with their idols. So I will make them jealous with those who are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</p>
  <p><strong>22</strong> For a fire has been kindled by my anger, and it will burn to the lowest hell, devour the earth and its harvest, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</p>
  <p><strong>23</strong> I will heap misfortunes upon them; I will spend my arrows on them.</p>
  <p><strong>24</strong> They shall be wasted with hunger, devoured by burning heat and bitter destruction; and I will send the teeth of beasts against them, with the venom of vipers that crawl in the dust.</p>
  <p><strong>25</strong> Outside the sword will bereave, and inside terror will destroy, both young man and virgin, the infant and the man of gray hairs.</p>
  <p><strong>26</strong> I said, “I would scatter them far and wide, I would make the memory of them to cease from among men,”</p>
  <p><strong>27</strong> if I had not feared the provocation of the enemy, lest their adversaries should misunderstand, lest they should say, “Our hand is triumphant, and it was not the LORD (YHWH) who did all this.”</p>
  <p><strong>28</strong> For they are a nation without sense, there is no understanding in them.</p>
  <p><strong>29</strong> If only they were wise, and would understand this, and consider their latter end!</p>
  <p><strong>30</strong> How could one have chased a thousand, and two have put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock (Tsur) had sold them, unless the LORD (YHWH) had given them up?</p>
  <p><strong>31</strong> For their rock (tsur) is not like our Rock (Tsur); even our enemies themselves being judges.</p>
  <p><strong>32</strong> For their vine is from the vine of Sodom (Burning), and from the fields of Gomorrah (Submersion); their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter;</p>
  <p><strong>33</strong> their wine is the poison of serpents, the cruel venom of asps.</p>
  <p><strong>34</strong> Is not this laid up in store with me, sealed up in my treasuries?</p>
  <p><strong>35</strong> Vengeance is mine, and recompense, for the time when their foot shall slip; for the day of their calamity is at hand, and their doom comes swiftly.</p>
  <p><strong>36</strong> For the LORD (YHWH) will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants, when he sees that their power is gone and there is none remaining, bond or free.</p>
  <p><strong>37</strong> And he will say, “Where are their gods (elohim), the rock (tsur) in whom they trusted,</p>
  <p><strong>38</strong> who ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up and help you, let them be your protection!</p>
  <p><strong>39</strong> See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god (elohim) beside me. I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.</p>
  <p><strong>40</strong> For I lift up my hand to heaven and say, “As surely as I live forever,”</p>
  <p><strong>41</strong> if I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand takes hold on judgment, I will render vengeance to my enemies and repay those who hate me.</p>
  <p><strong>42</strong> I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword will devour flesh, with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the head of the leaders of the enemy.”</p>
  <p><strong>43</strong> Rejoice, O heavens, with him, and let all the angels of God (Elohim) worship him. Rejoice, O nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants and will render vengeance to his adversaries and make atonement for his land and his people.</p>
  <p><strong>44</strong> And Moses (Drawn out) came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Hoshea (Salvation) the son of Nun (Fish),</p>
  <p><strong>45</strong> when Moses (Drawn out) had finished speaking all these words to all Israel (God prevails),</p>
  <p><strong>46</strong> he said to them, “Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law.</p>
  <p><strong>47</strong> They are not just idle words for you—they are your life. By them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”</p>
  <p><strong>48</strong> On that same day the LORD (YHWH) told Moses (Drawn out),</p>
  <p><strong>49</strong> “Go up into this mountain of Abarim (Regions beyond), to Mount Nebo (The prophet), which is in the land of Moab (From father), across from Jericho (City of the moon), and view the land of Canaan (The merchant), which I am giving to the Israelites (God prevails) as their possession.</p>
  <p><strong>50</strong> There on the mountain that you have climbed, you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron (Exalted) died on Mount Hor (Mountain of the cavern) and was gathered to his people.</p>
  <p><strong>51</strong> This is because both of you broke faith with me in the presence of the Israelites (God prevails) at the waters of Meribah (Strife), Kadesh (Holy place), in the wilderness of Zin (Clay), and because you did not uphold my holiness among the Israelites (God prevails).</p>
  <p><strong>52</strong> Therefore, you will see the land only from a distance; you will not enter the land I am giving to the Israelites (God prevails).”</p>
