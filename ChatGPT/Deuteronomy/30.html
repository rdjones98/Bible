    <h1>Deuteronomy 30 - Literal Translation</h1>
    <p>1. And it shall be, when come upon you all these words, the blessing and the curse, which I have given before you, and you bring back to your heart among all the nations where the Lord (YHWH - He Who Exists) your God (Elohim - Mighty Ones) has driven you,</p>
    <p>2. And you return to the Lord your God and listen to His voice, according to all that I command you today, you and your sons, with all your heart and with all your soul,</p>
    <p>3. Then the Lord your God will turn your captivity and have compassion on you, and He will return and gather you from all the peoples where the Lord your God has scattered you.</p>
    <p>4. If your outcasts are at the end of the heavens, from there the Lord your God will gather you, and from there He will take you.</p>
    <p>5. And the Lord your God will bring you to the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and He will do good to you and multiply you more than your fathers.</p>
    <p>6. And the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your seed, to love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.</p>
    <p>7. And the Lord your God will put all these curses upon your enemies and upon those who hate you, who have persecuted you.</p>
    <p>8. And you will return and listen to the voice of the Lord and do all His commandments which I command you today.</p>
    <p>9. And the Lord your God will make you abound in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your womb, and in the fruit of your cattle, and in the fruit of your ground, for good; for the Lord will return to rejoice over you for good, as He rejoiced over your fathers,</p>
    <p>10. If you listen to the voice of the Lord your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes that are written in this book of the Torah, and if you return to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.</p>
    <p>11. For this commandment which I command you today, it is not too wondrous for you, nor is it far off.</p>
    <p>12. It is not in the heavens, that you should say, "Who will go up for us to the heavens and take it for us and cause us to hear it, that we may do it?"</p>
    <p>13. And it is not beyond the sea, that you should say, "Who will cross over for us beyond the sea and take it for us and cause us to hear it, that we may do it?"</p>
    <p>14. For the word is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, to do it.</p>
    <p>15. See, I have set before you today life and good, and death and evil,</p>
    <p>16. In that I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments, and you shall live and multiply, and the Lord your God will bless you in the land where you go to possess it.</p>
    <p>17. But if your heart turns, and you do not listen, and you are drawn away and bow down to other gods and serve them,</p>
    <p>18. I declare to you today that you shall surely perish; you shall not prolong your days upon the land where you pass over the Jordan (Descender) to go to possess it.</p>
    <p>19. I call the heavens and the earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore, choose life, so that you and your seed may live,</p>
    <p>20. To love the Lord your God, to listen to His voice, and to cling to Him, for He is your life and the length of your days, to dwell upon the land which the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham (Father of a Multitude), to Isaac (He Laughs), and to Jacob (Heel Catcher), to give them.</p>
