    <h2>Ruth 4</h2>

    <p><strong>1</strong> Now Boaz (Bo‘az – In Him is Strength) went up to the gate and sat down there. And behold, the redeemer of whom Boaz had spoken came by. So Boaz said, “Turn aside, friend; sit down here.” And he turned aside and sat down.</p>

    <p><strong>2</strong> Then Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down.</p>

    <p><strong>3</strong> He said to the redeemer, “Naomi (Na‘omi – Pleasantness), who has come back from the territory of Moab (Moav – From Father), is selling the parcel of land that belonged to our relative Elimelech (Eli-melekh – My God is King).</p>

    <p><strong>4</strong> So I thought I would inform you and say, ‘Buy it in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people.’ If you will redeem it, redeem it. But if you will not, tell me, so that I may know. For there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I come after you.” And he said, “I will redeem it.”</p>

    <p><strong>5</strong> Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth (Rut – Companion) the Moabitess (from Moav – From Father), the widow of the dead, in order to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.”</p>

    <p><strong>6</strong> Then the redeemer said, “I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I impair my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem it.”</p>

    <p><strong>7</strong> Now this was the custom in former times in Israel (Yisra’el – God Strives) concerning redeeming and exchanging: to confirm a transaction, one drew off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the manner of attesting in Israel.</p>

    <p><strong>8</strong> So when the redeemer said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” he drew off his sandal.</p>

    <p><strong>9</strong> Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses this day that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech (Eli-melekh – My God is King) and all that belonged to Chilion (Kilyon – Wasting) and Mahlon (Machlon – Sickly).</p>

    <p><strong>10</strong> Also Ruth (Rut – Companion) the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon (Machlon – Sickly), I have acquired to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, so that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his relatives and from the gate of his native place. You are witnesses this day.”</p>

    <p><strong>11</strong> Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, “We are witnesses. May the <em>LORD</em> (YHWH – He is) make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel (Rachel – Ewe) and Leah (Le’ah – Weary), who together built up the house of Israel. May you act worthily in Ephrathah (Efratah – Fruitful) and be renowned in Bethlehem (Beit Lechem – House of Bread).</p>

    <p><strong>12</strong> And may your house be like the house of Perez (Peretz – Breach), whom Tamar (Tamar – Palm Tree) bore to Judah (Yehudah – Praise), because of the offspring that the LORD will give you by this young woman.”</p>

    <p><strong>13</strong> So Boaz took Ruth (Rut – Companion), and she became his wife. He went in to her, and the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.</p>

    <p><strong>14</strong> Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without a redeemer, and may his name be renowned in Israel!</p>

    <p><strong>15</strong> He shall be to you a restorer of life and a sustainer of your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.”</p>

    <p><strong>16</strong> Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her lap and became his nurse.</p>

    <p><strong>17</strong> The women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, “A son has been born to Naomi.” They named him Obed (Oved – Servant). He was the father of Jesse (Yishai – Gift), the father of David (David – Beloved).</p>

    <p><strong>18</strong> Now these are the generations of Perez (Peretz – Breach): Perez fathered Hezron (Chetzron – Enclosure),</p>

    <p><strong>19</strong> Hezron (Chetzron – Enclosure) fathered Ram (Ram – Exalted), Ram fathered Amminadab (Amminadav – My People Are Noble),</p>

    <p><strong>20</strong> Amminadab (Amminadav – My People Are Noble) fathered Nahshon (Nachshon – Enchanter), Nahshon fathered Salmon (Salmon – Garment),</p>

    <p><strong>21</strong> Salmon (Salmon – Garment) fathered Boaz,</p>

    <p><strong>22</strong> Boaz fathered Obed (Oved – Servant), Obed fathered Jesse (Yishai – Gift), and Jesse fathered David (David – Beloved).</p>
