    <h1>Ruth 1 – Modern English Translation</h1>

    <p><strong>1</strong> In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem (Beit Lechem – House of Bread) in Judah (Yehudah – Praise) went to live in the territory of Moab (Moav – From Father) with his wife and two sons.</p>

    <p><strong>2</strong> The name of the man was Elimelech (Eli-melekh – My God is King), and the name of his wife was Naomi (Na‘omi – Pleasantness). The names of his two sons were Mahlon (Machlon – Sickly) and Chilion (Kilyon – Wasting). They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem (Beit Lechem – House of Bread) in Judah (Yehudah – Praise). They came to the territory of Moab (Moav – From Father) and remained there.</p>

    <p><strong>3</strong> Then Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died, and she was left with her two sons.</p>

    <p><strong>4</strong> They took Moabite wives. The name of one was Orpah (Orpah – Back of the Neck), and the name of the other was Ruth (Rut – Companion). They lived there about ten years.</p>

    <p><strong>5</strong> Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and the woman was left without her two sons and without her husband.</p>

    <p><strong>6</strong> Then she arose with her daughters-in-law to return from the territory of Moab, because she had heard in the land of Moab that the <em>LORD</em> (YHWH – He is) had visited His people by giving them food.</p>

    <p><strong>7</strong> So she went out from the place where she had been living, and her two daughters-in-law were with her. They set out on the road to return to the land of Judah (Yehudah – Praise).</p>

    <p><strong>8</strong> Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each of you to your mother’s house. May the LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.</p>

    <p><strong>9</strong> May the LORD grant that you find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.” Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept.</p>

    <p><strong>10</strong> They said to her, “No, we will return with you to your people.”</p>

    <p><strong>11</strong> But Naomi said, “Turn back, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb that they may be your husbands?</p>

    <p><strong>12</strong> Turn back, my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. If I thought there was still hope for me, even if I had a husband tonight and bore sons,</p>

    <p><strong>13</strong> would you wait for them till they were grown? Would you refrain from marrying? No, my daughters. It is much more bitter for me than for you, because the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.”</p>

    <p><strong>14</strong> Then they lifted up their voices and wept again. Orpah (Orpah – Back of the Neck) kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.</p>

    <p><strong>15</strong> Naomi said, “See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.”</p>

    <p><strong>16</strong> But Ruth said, “Do not urge me to leave you or to turn back from following you. For where you go, I will go; and where you stay, I will stay. Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.</p>

    <p><strong>17</strong> Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.”</p>

    <p><strong>18</strong> When Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped speaking to her.</p>

    <p><strong>19</strong> So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem (Beit Lechem – House of Bread). When they arrived in Bethlehem (Beit Lechem – House of Bread), the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women said, “Is this Naomi?”</p>

    <p><strong>20</strong> She said to them, “Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara (Marah – Bitter), for the Almighty (Shaddai – All-Sufficient) has dealt very bitterly with me.</p>

    <p><strong>21</strong> I went out full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi, when the LORD has testified against me and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me?”</p>

    <p><strong>22</strong> So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess (from Moav – From Father), her daughter-in-law, returned with her from the territory of Moab. They came to Bethlehem (Beit Lechem – House of Bread) at the beginning of the barley harvest.</p>
