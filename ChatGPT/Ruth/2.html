	<h1>Ruth 2 – Modern English Translation</h1>

    <p><strong>1</strong> Now Naomi (Na‘omi – Pleasantness) had a relative on her husband’s side, a man of standing from the clan of Elimelech (Eli-melekh – My God is King), whose name was Boaz (Bo‘az – In Him is Strength).</p>

    <p><strong>2</strong> Ruth (Rut – Companion) the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields and glean among the ears of grain after someone in whose eyes I may find favor.” Naomi said to her, “Go, my daughter.”</p>

    <p><strong>3</strong> So she went out, entered a field, and began to glean behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she was working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech (Eli-melekh – My God is King).</p>

    <p><strong>4</strong> Just then, Boaz came from Bethlehem (Beit Lechem – House of Bread) and said to the harvesters, “The <em>LORD</em> (YHWH – He is) be with you!” They answered, “The LORD bless you!”</p>

    <p><strong>5</strong> Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the harvesters, “Whose young woman is this?”</p>

    <p><strong>6</strong> The servant replied, “She is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the territory of Moab (Moav – From Father).</p>

    <p><strong>7</strong> She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.’ She came and has continued from morning until now, except for a short rest in the shelter.”</p>

    <p><strong>8</strong> Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but stay close to my young women.</p>

    <p><strong>9</strong> Keep your eyes on the field where they are harvesting and follow after them. I have told the young men not to touch you. When you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink from what the young men have drawn.”</p>

    <p><strong>10</strong> Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, a foreigner?”</p>

    <p><strong>11</strong> Boaz replied, “All that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully reported to me: how you left your father and mother and the land of your birth and came to a people you did not know before.</p>

    <p><strong>12</strong> May the LORD reward your work, and may you receive a full reward from the LORD, the God of Israel (Yisra’el – God Strives), under whose wings you have come to take refuge.”</p>

    <p><strong>13</strong> Then she said, “May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord. You have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not one of your servants.”</p>

    <p><strong>14</strong> At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come here and eat some bread and dip your piece in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the harvesters, and he passed her roasted grain. She ate and was satisfied and had some left over.</p>

    <p><strong>15</strong> When she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not humiliate her.</p>

    <p><strong>16</strong> Also pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to glean. Do not rebuke her.”</p>

    <p><strong>17</strong> So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</p>

    <p><strong>18</strong> She carried it back to the town, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she was satisfied.</p>

    <p><strong>19</strong> Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you.” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked. She said, “The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz.”</p>

    <p><strong>20</strong> Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by the LORD, whose kindness has not forsaken the living or the dead!” Naomi continued, “That man is a relative of ours, one of our close redeemers.”</p>

    <p><strong>21</strong> Then Ruth the Moabitess said, “He also said to me, ‘Stay close to my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’”</p>

    <p><strong>22</strong> Naomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, so that you will not be harmed in another field.”</p>

    <p><strong>23</strong> So she stayed close to Boaz’s young women and gleaned until the end of the barley and wheat harvests. And she lived with her mother-in-law.</p>
