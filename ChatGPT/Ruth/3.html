    <h1>Ruth 3</h1>

    <p><strong>1</strong> Then Naomi (Na‘omi – Pleasantness), Ruth’s (Rut – Companion) mother-in-law, said to her, "My daughter, should I not seek a home for you, that it may be well with you?</p>

    <p><strong>2</strong> Now, is not Boaz (Bo‘az – In Him is Strength), with whose young women you have been working, our relative? Behold, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.</p>

    <p><strong>3</strong> Wash, anoint yourself, put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor. But do not let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.</p>

    <p><strong>4</strong> When he lies down, note the place where he lies. Then go, uncover his feet, and lie down. He will tell you what to do."</p>

    <p><strong>5</strong> Ruth said to her, "All that you say I will do."</p>

    <p><strong>6</strong> So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had commanded her.</p>

    <p><strong>7</strong> When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came softly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.</p>

    <p><strong>8</strong> At midnight, the man was startled and turned over, and behold, a woman was lying at his feet!</p>

    <p><strong>9</strong> He said, "Who are you?" And she answered, "I am Ruth, your servant. Spread your garment over your servant, for you are a redeemer."
    </p>

    <p><strong>10</strong> He said, "May you be blessed by the <em>LORD</em> (YHWH – He is), my daughter. You have shown more kindness now than at first, in that you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich.</p>

    <p><strong>11</strong> And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you ask, for all the people of my town know that you are a woman of noble character.</p>

    <p><strong>12</strong> Now it is true that I am a redeemer. Yet there is a redeemer nearer than I.</p>

    <p><strong>13</strong> Stay here tonight, and in the morning, if he will redeem you, good—let him do it. But if he is not willing to redeem you, then, as the LORD lives, I will redeem you. Lie down until morning."</p>

    <p><strong>14</strong> So she lay at his feet until morning but rose before anyone could be recognized. And he said, "Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor."</p>

    <p><strong>15</strong> He said, "Bring the cloak you are wearing and hold it out." So she held it, and he measured out six measures of barley and laid it on her. Then she went into the city.</p>

    <p><strong>16</strong> When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, "How did it go, my daughter?" Then she told her all that the man had done for her,</p>

    <p><strong>17</strong> saying, "He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said, 'Do not go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'"</p>

    <p><strong>18</strong> Then Naomi said, "Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out, for the man will not rest until he has settled the matter today."</p>
