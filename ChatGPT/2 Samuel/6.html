<h1>2 Samuel 6</h1>

<p><strong>1.</strong> David (Dawid – Beloved) again gathered all the chosen men of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives), thirty thousand.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale-Judah (Ba‘alei-Yehudah – Lords of Judah), to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name (shem shem YHWH), the name of the LORD (YHWH – He is) of hosts, who is enthroned between the cherubim on the ark.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab (Avinadav – My father is noble), which was on the hill. Uzzah (Uzzah – Strength) and Ahio (Achyo – His brother), the sons of Abinadab, were driving the new cart.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill, with the ark of God; and Ahio went before the ark.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> And David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD with all kinds of instruments made of cypress wood, with harps, lyres, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals.</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> But when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon (Nakon – Prepared), Uzzah reached out toward the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen had stumbled.</p>

<p><strong>7.</strong> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and God struck him there for his irreverence. He died there beside the ark of God.</p>

<p><strong>8.</strong> David was angry because the LORD had broken out against Uzzah. That place is called Perez-Uzzah (Peretz-Uzzah – Breakthrough against Uzzah) to this day.</p>

<p><strong>9.</strong> David was afraid of the LORD that day, and he said, "How can the ark of the LORD come to me?"</p>

<p><strong>10.</strong> So David was unwilling to move the ark of the LORD into the city of David. Instead, David took it aside to the house of Obed-Edom (Oved-Edom – Servant of Edom) the Gittite (Resident of Gath/Philistia.  Probably a Levite living in Gath).</p>

<p><strong>11.</strong> The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-Edom and all his household.</p>

<p><strong>12.</strong> And it was told to King David, "The LORD has blessed the household of Obed-Edom and all that belongs to him because of the ark of God." So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the city of David with rejoicing.</p>

<p><strong>13.</strong> And when those who carried the ark of the LORD had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened animal.</p>

<p><strong>14.</strong> David danced before the LORD with all his might. David was wearing a linen ephod.</p>

<p><strong>15.</strong> So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and with the sound of the ram’s horn.</p>

<p><strong>16.</strong> As the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal (Mikhal – Who is like God), the daughter of Saul (Sha'ul – Asked For), looked out the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, and she despised him in her heart.</p>

<p><strong>17.</strong> They brought in the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.</p>

<p><strong>18.</strong> When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p><strong>19.</strong> And he distributed among all the people, the whole multitude of Israel, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins to each one. Then all the people went home.</p>

<p><strong>20.</strong> David returned to bless his household. But Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, "How the king of Israel honored himself today—uncovering himself today before the eyes of his servants' maids as one of the vulgar fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!"</p>

<p><strong>21.</strong> David said to Michal, "It was before the LORD, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me as ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel—I will celebrate before the LORD."</p>

<p><strong>22.</strong> "I will be even more undignified than this, and I will be humble in my own eyes. But by the maids of whom you have spoken, by them I shall be held in honor."</p>

<p><strong>23.</strong> And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.</p>
