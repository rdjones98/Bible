<h1>2 Samuel 1</h1>

<p><strong>1.</strong> After the death of Saul (Sha'ul – Asked For), David (Dawid – Beloved) returned from striking down the Amalekites, and he stayed in Ziklag (Tziklag – Winding) for two days.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> On the third day, a man came from the camp of Saul with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground and bowed low.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> David said to him, "Where do you come from?" He said, "I have escaped from the camp of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives)."</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> David said to him, "What happened? Tell me." He answered, "The people fled from the battle, many of the people have fallen and died, and Saul and Jonathan (Yonatan – YHWH has given) his son are dead."</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Then David said to the young man who told him, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> The young man who told him said, "By chance I was on Mount Gilboa (Gilboa – Boiling Spring), and there was Saul leaning on his spear. The chariots and horsemen were closing in on him.</p>

<p><strong>7.</strong> When he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. I answered, ‘Here I am.’</p>

<p><strong>8.</strong> He said to me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite (Amaleqi – Descendant of Amalek).’</p>

<p><strong>9.</strong> Then he said to me, ‘Please stand over me and kill me, for agony has seized me, but my life still lingers.’</p>

<p><strong>10.</strong> So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord."</p>

<p><strong>11.</strong> Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so did all the men who were with him.</p>

<p><strong>12.</strong> They mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul, for Jonathan his son, for the people of the LORD (YHWH – He is), and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</p>

<p><strong>13.</strong> David said to the young man who had told him, "Where are you from?" He answered, "I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite."</p>

<p><strong>14.</strong> David said to him, "How is it that you were not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?"</p>

<p><strong>15.</strong> Then David called one of the young men and said, "Go, strike him down." So he struck him down, and he died.</p>

<p><strong>16.</strong> David said to him, "Your blood is on your own head, for your own mouth testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed the LORD’s anointed.’"</p>

<p><strong>17.</strong> Then David chanted this lament over Saul and over Jonathan his son,</p>

<p><strong>18.</strong> and he said to teach the sons of Judah (Yehudah – Praise) the song of the bow. Behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar (Sefer haYashar – Book of the Upright):</p>

<p><strong>19.</strong> "Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your high places!  
How the mighty have fallen!</p>

<p><strong>20.</strong> Do not tell it in Gath (Gat – Winepress),  
Do not proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon (Ashqelon – Weighing place),  
Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,  
Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.</p>

<p><strong>21.</strong> O mountains of Gilboa,  
Let there be no dew or rain upon you, nor fields of offerings!  
For there the shield of the mighty was defiled—  
The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</p>

<p><strong>22.</strong> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,  
The bow of Jonathan did not turn back,  
And the sword of Saul did not return empty.</p>

<p><strong>23.</strong> Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely!  
In life and in death they were not divided.  
They were swifter than eagles,  
They were stronger than lions.</p>

<p><strong>24.</strong> O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,  
Who clothed you luxuriously in scarlet,  
Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.</p>

<p><strong>25.</strong> How the mighty have fallen  
In the midst of the battle!  
Jonathan lies slain on your high places.</p>

<p><strong>26.</strong> I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan;  
Very pleasant have you been to me;  
Your love to me was extraordinary,  
Surpassing the love of women.</p>

<p><strong>27.</strong> How the mighty have fallen,  
And the weapons of war perished!"</p>
