  <h1>Judges 2</h1>

  <p><strong>1</strong> The <a href="../Commentary/angelofgod.html">angel of the Lord (mal’akh YHWH - messenger of YHWH)</a> went up from <strong>Gilgal (Gilgal – Circle)</strong> to <strong>Bokim (Bochim – Weepers)</strong> and said, “I brought you up out of <strong>Egypt (Mitzrayim – Narrow places)</strong> and led you into the land which I swore to your fathers. I said, ‘I will never break My covenant with you,</p>

  <p><strong>2</strong> and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed My voice. What is this you have done?</p>

  <p><strong>3</strong> Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out before you, but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.’”</p>

  <p><strong>4</strong> When the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the people of <strong>Israel (Yisra’el – God strives)</strong>, the people lifted up their voices and wept.</p>

  <p><strong>5</strong> They called the name of that place <strong>Bokim (Bochim – Weepers)</strong>, and they sacrificed there to <strong>the LORD (YHWH – He is)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>6</strong> When <strong>Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation)</strong> had sent the people away, the children of Israel went each to his inheritance to possess the land.</p>

  <p><strong>7</strong> The people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived , who had seen all the great work of the Lord that He had done for Israel.</p>

  <p><strong>8</strong> Joshua the son of <strong>Nun (Nun – Fish or Posterity)</strong>, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of 110 years.</p>

  <p><strong>9</strong> They buried him within the boundaries of his inheritance in <strong>Timnath-Heres (Timnat-Cheres – Portion of the Sun)</strong>, in the hill country of <strong>Ephraim (Efrayim – Fruitful)</strong>, north of <strong>Mount Gaash (Har Ga’ash – Quaking Mountain)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>10</strong> Also, all that generation were gathered to their fathers. Another generation arose after them who did not know the Lord, nor the work that He had done for Israel.</p>

  <p><strong>11</strong> The children of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and served the <strong>Baals (Ba’alim – Lords)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>12</strong> They abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods from among the gods of the peoples who were around them. They bowed down to them and provoked the Lord to anger.</p>

  <p><strong>13</strong> They abandoned the Lord and served Baal and the <strong>Ashtaroth (Ashtarot – Goddesses)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>14</strong> The anger of the Lord burned against Israel, and He gave them into the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their surrounding enemies so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.</p>

  <p><strong>15</strong> Wherever they went, the hand of the Lord was against them for harm, as the Lord had spoken and sworn to them, and they were in great distress.</p>

  <p><strong>16</strong> Then the Lord raised up judges, who delivered them out of the hands of those who plundered them.</p>

  <p><strong>17</strong> Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed down to them. They quickly turned aside from the way in which their ancestors walked in obedience to the commandments of the Lord; they did not do so.</p>

  <p><strong>18</strong> When the Lord raised up judges for them, the Lord was with the judge, and He saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For the Lord was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed and afflicted them.</p>

  <p><strong>19</strong> But when the judge died, they turned back and acted more corruptly than their fathers, following other gods to serve and bow down to them. They did not cease from their practices or their stubborn ways.</p>

  <p><strong>20</strong> So the anger of the Lord burned against Israel. He said, “Because this nation has transgressed My covenant that I commanded their fathers and has not listened to My voice,</p>

  <p><strong>21</strong> I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died,</p>

  <p><strong>22</strong> in order to test Israel by them, whether they will keep the way of the Lord and walk in it as their fathers did, or not.”</p>

  <p><strong>23</strong> So the Lord left those nations, not driving them out quickly. He did not give them into the hand of Joshua.</p>
