  <h1>Judges 4</h1>

  <p><b>1</b> The children of Israel (Yisra'el – God strives) again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD (YHWH – He is) after Ehud (Ehud – Unity) died.</p>

  <p><b>2</b> So the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin (Yavin – Discerner) king of Canaan (Kena'an – Lowland), who reigned in Hazor (Hatzor – Enclosed). The commander of his army was Sisera (Sisra – Battle Array), who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim (Charoshet haGoyim – Forest of the Nations).</p>

  <p><b>3</b> Then the children of Israel cried out to the LORD, for he had nine hundred iron chariots, and he harshly oppressed the children of Israel for twenty years.</p>

  <p><b>4</b> Now Deborah (Devorah – Bee), a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth (Lappidot – Torches), was judging Israel at that time.</p>

  <p><b>5</b> She used to sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah (Ramah – Height) and Bethel (Beit-El – House of God) in the hill country of Ephraim (Efrayim – Fruitful), and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</p>

  <p><b>6</b> She sent and summoned Barak (Barak – Lightning) the son of Abinoam (Avino'am – My Father is Delight) from Kedesh (Kedesh – Holy Place) in Naphtali (Naftali – My Wrestling), and said to him, "Has not the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded you, 'Go, gather your men at Mount Tabor (Har Tavor – Broken/Ridge), taking ten thousand from the people of Naphtali (Naftali) and the people of Zebulun (Zevulun – Dwelling)?</p>

  <p><b>7</b> And I will draw out Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, to meet you by the river Kishon (Kishon – Winding), with his chariots and his troops, and I will give him into your hand.'"</p>

  <p><b>8</b> Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go."</p>

  <p><b>9</b> She said, "I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman." Then Deborah arose and went with Barak (Barak) to Kedesh.</p>

  <p><b>10</b> Barak called Zebulun (Zevulun – Dwelling) and Naphtali (Naftali – My Wrestling) to Kedesh, and ten thousand men went up at his heels, and Deborah went up with him.</p>

  <p><b>11</b> Now Heber (Chever – Comrade) the Kenite (Keini – Smith) had separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab (Chovav – Beloved), the father-in-law of Moses (Moshe – Drawn Out), and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim (Tza'ananim – Wanderings), which is near Kedesh.</p>

  <p><b>12</b> When Sisera was told that Barak the son of Abinoam (Avino'am – My Father is Delight) had gone up to Mount Tabor (Har Tavor – Ridge),</p>

  <p><b>13</b> Sisera called out all his chariots, nine hundred iron chariots, and all the men who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim (Charoshet haGoyim – Forest of the Nations) to the river Kishon (Kishon – Winding).</p>

  <p><b>14</b> Deborah said to Barak, "Up! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sisera into your hand. Does not the LORD go out before you?" So Barak (Barak) went down from Mount Tabor (Har Tavor – Ridge) with ten thousand men following him.</p>

  <p><b>15</b> And the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army before Barak by the edge of the sword. Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot.</p>

  <p><b>16</b> Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoyim (Charoshet haGoyim – Forest of the Nations), and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.</p>

  <p><b>17</b> But Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael (Ya'el – Mountain Goat), the wife of Heber the Kenite (Keini – Smith), for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor (Hatzor – Enclosed) and the house of Heber the Kenite.</p>

  <p><b>18</b> Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; do not be afraid." So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.</p>

  <p><b>19</b> He said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him.</p>

  <p><b>20</b> And he said to her, "Stand at the opening of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, ‘Is anyone here?’ say, ‘No.’"</p>

  <p><b>21</b> But Jael, the wife of Heber, took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand. Then she went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple until it went down into the ground while he was lying fast asleep from weariness. So he died.</p>

  <p><b>22</b> And behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking." So he went in to her tent, and there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg in his temple.</p>

  <p><b>23</b> So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</p>

  <p><b>24</b> And the hand of the children of Israel pressed harder and harder against Jabin the king of Canaan (Kena'an), until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</p>
