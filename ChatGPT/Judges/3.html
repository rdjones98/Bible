  <h1>Judges 3</h1>

  <p><strong>1</strong> Now these are the nations that <strong>the LORD (YHWH – He is)</strong> left to test <strong>Israel (Yisra’el – God strives)</strong> by them—that is, all who had not known any of the wars in <strong>Canaan (Kena'an – Lowland)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>2</strong> It was only in order that the generations of the children of Israel might know war, to teach war to those who had not known it before:</p>

  <p><strong>3</strong> the five lords of the <strong>Philistines (Pelishtim – Immigrants)</strong>, all the <strong>Canaanites (Kena'anim – Lowlanders)</strong>, the <strong>Sidonians (Tzidonim – Fishers)</strong>, and the <strong>Hivites (Chivvim – Villagers)</strong> who lived on <strong>Mount Lebanon (Har Levanon – White Mountain)</strong>, from <strong>Mount Baal-Hermon (Har Ba‘al-Ḥermon – Lord of the Devoted Mountain)</strong> as far as <strong>Lebo-Hamath (Levo-Hamat – Entrance to Hamath)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>4</strong> They were left to test Israel, to know whether they would obey the commandments of the Lord, which He had commanded their fathers by the hand of <strong>Moses (Mosheh – Drawn out)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>5</strong> The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites</strong>, <strong>Hittites (Chittim – Terror)</strong>, <strong>Amorites (Emorim – Talkers)</strong>, <strong>Perizzites (Perizzim – Dwellers in open country)</strong>, <strong>Hivites (Chivvim)</strong>, and <strong>Jebusites (Yevusim – Trampled-down)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>6</strong> They took their daughters for themselves as wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</p>

  <p><strong>7</strong> The children of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. They forgot the Lord their God, and served the <strong>Baals (Ba’alim – Lords)</strong> and the <strong>Asheroth (Asherot – Poles or Goddesses)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>8</strong> Therefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of <strong>Cushan-Rishathaim (Kushan Rish‘atayim – Cushan of Double Wickedness)</strong>, king of <strong>Aram-Naharaim (Aram Naharayim – Aram of the Two Rivers)</strong>. The children of Israel served Cushan-Rishathaim eight years.</p>

  <p><strong>9</strong> When the children of Israel cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer for the children of Israel, who saved them—<strong>Othniel (Otniel – Lion of God)</strong> son of <strong>Kenaz (Kenaz – Hunter)</strong>, Caleb’s younger brother.</p>

  <p><strong>10</strong> The Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the Lord gave Cushan-Rishathaim king of <strong>Aram (Aram – Exalted)</strong> into his hand. His hand prevailed over Cushan-Rishathaim.</p>

  <p><strong>11</strong> So the land had rest for forty years. Then <strong>Othniel (Otniel – Lion of God)</strong> son of <strong>Kenaz (Kenaz – Hunter)</strong> died.</p>

  <p><strong>12</strong> The children of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord strengthened <strong>Eglon (Eglon – Calf-like)</strong> king of <strong>Moab (Mo’av – From Father)</strong> against Israel, because they had done what was evil in <strong>the LORD’s (YHWH – He is)</strong> sight.</p>

  <p><strong>13</strong> He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the <strong>Amalekites (Amalekim – Dwellers in the valley)</strong>, and went and struck Israel. They took possession of the city of palms.</p>

  <p><strong>14</strong> The children of Israel served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.</p>

  <p><strong>15</strong> But when the children of Israel cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer for them—<strong>Ehud (Ehud – United or Strong)</strong> son of <strong>Gera (Gera – Grain or Pilgrimage)</strong>, the <strong>Benjamite (Binyamini – Son of the right hand)</strong>, a left-handed man. The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon king of Moab.</p>

  <p><strong>16</strong> Ehud made himself a double-edged sword about a cubit long, and he strapped it under his clothes on his right thigh.</p>

  <p><strong>17</strong> He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was a very fat man.</p>

  <p><strong>18</strong> When he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute.</p>

  <p><strong>19</strong> But he himself turned back from the idols near <strong>Gilgal (Gilgal – Circle)</strong>, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” And he said, “Silence!” So all who attended him went out.</p>

  <p><strong>20</strong> Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” So he arose from his seat.</p>

  <p><strong>21</strong> Then Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.</p>

  <p><strong>22</strong> The hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not pull the sword out of his belly. And the dung came out.</p>

  <p><strong>23</strong> Then Ehud went out through the vestibule, closed the doors of the roof chamber behind him, and locked them.</p>

  <p><strong>24</strong> After he had gone, the servants came and saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked. They said, “He must be relieving himself in the cool room.”</p>

  <p><strong>25</strong> They waited until they were embarrassed, but he still did not open the doors. So they took the key and opened them, and there lay their lord dead on the floor.</p>

  <p><strong>26</strong> Ehud escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the idols and escaped to <strong>Seirah (Se’irah – Hairy or Forested)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>27</strong> When he arrived, he blew the shofar in the hill country of <strong>Ephraim (Efrayim – Fruitful)</strong>, and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he led them.</p>

  <p><strong>28</strong> He said to them, “Follow me, for the Lord has given your enemies the <strong>Moabites (Mo’avim – From Father)</strong> into your hand.” So they followed him and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and did not allow anyone to cross over.</p>

  <p><strong>29</strong> They struck down about ten thousand men of Moab, all strong and able-bodied; not a man escaped.</p>

  <p><strong>30</strong> So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.</p>

  <p><strong>31</strong> After him was <strong>Shamgar (Shamgar – Sword or Stranger)</strong> son of <strong>Anath (Anat – Answer or Affliction)</strong>, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. He also saved Israel.</p>
