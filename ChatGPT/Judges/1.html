  <h1>Judges 1</h1>

  <p><b>1</b> After the death of Joshua (Yehoshua – YHWH is salvation), the children of Israel (Yisra’el – God strives) asked the LORD (YHWH – He is), saying, "Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites (Kena‘anim – Lowlanders) to fight against them?"</p>

  <p><b>2</b> The LORD said, "Judah (Yehudah – Praise) shall go up. Behold, I have given the land into his hand."</p>

  <p><b>3</b> Judah said to Simeon (Shimon – Heard) his brother, "Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with you into your territory." So Simeon went with him.</p>

  <p><b>4</b> Then Judah went up, and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites (Perizzi – Dwellers in open country) into their hand. They struck down ten thousand men at Bezek (Bezeq – Lightning).</p>

  <p><b>5</b> They found Adoni-Bezek (Adoni-Bezeq – Lord of Lightning) at Bezek, fought against him, and struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</p>

  <p><b>6</b> Adoni-Bezek fled, but they pursued him, seized him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.</p>

  <p><b>7</b> Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather scraps under my table. As I have done, so God has repaid me." They brought him to Jerusalem (Yerushalayim – Foundation of Peace), and he died there.</p>

  <p><b>8</b> The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, captured it, struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</p>

  <p><b>9</b> Afterward, the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, the Negev (Negev – South), and the lowland.</p>

  <p><b>10</b> Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (Chevron – Association), and the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-Arba (Kiryat Arba – City of Four). They defeated Sheshai (Sheshai – Whitish), Ahiman (Achiman – My brother is a gift), and Talmai (Talmai – Furrowed).</p>

  <p><b>11</b> From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir (Devir – Sanctuary), the name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-Sepher (Kiryat-Sefer – City of the Book).</p>

  <p><b>12</b> Caleb (Kalev – Whole-hearted) said, "Whoever attacks Kiriath-Sepher and captures it, I will give him my daughter Achsah (Achsah – Anklet) as a wife."</p>

  <p><b>13</b> Othniel (Otniel – God is my strength) the son of Kenaz (Kenaz – Hunter), Caleb's younger brother, captured it. So he gave him Achsah his daughter as a wife.</p>

  <p><b>14</b> When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. She dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?"</p>

  <p><b>15</b> She said to him, "Give me a blessing. Since you have given me land in the Negev (Negev – South), give me also springs of water." So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</p>

  <p><b>16</b> The descendants of the Kenite (Qeini – Smith), Moses’ (Moshe – Drawn Out) father-in-law, went up from the City of Palms with the people of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negev (Negev – South) near Arad (Arad – Fugitive), and they settled among the people.</p>

  <p><b>17</b> Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they defeated the Canaanites living in Zephath (Tzefat – Watchtower), and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah (Chormah – Destruction).</p>

  <p><b>18</b> Judah also captured Gaza (Azzah – Strong), Ashkelon (Ashqelon – Weighing place), and Ekron (Eqron – Uprooted), with their territories.</p>

  <p><b>19</b> The LORD was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country. But he could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain, because they had chariots of iron.</p>

  <p><b>20</b> They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses (Moshe) had said, and he drove out the three sons of Anak (Anak – Long-necked) from there.</p>

  <p><b>21</b> But the children of Benjamin (Binyamin – Son of the right hand) did not drive out the Jebusites (Yevusi – Trampled), who lived in Jerusalem. So the Jebusites live with the children of Benjamin (Binyamin) in Jerusalem to this day.</p>

  <p><b>22</b> The house of Joseph (Yosef – He adds) also went up against Bethel (Beit-El – House of God), and the LORD was with them.</p>

  <p><b>23</b> The house of Joseph sent spies to Bethel (Beit-El) (the name of the city before was Luz – Almond Tree).</p>

  <p><b>24</b> The spies saw a man coming out of the city and said to him, "Please show us the entrance to the city, and we will deal kindly with you."</p>

  <p><b>25</b> He showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go free.</p>

  <p><b>26</b> The man went to the land of the Hittites (Chitti – Terror), built a city, and called its name Luz (Luz – Almond Tree), which is its name to this day.</p>

  <p><b>27</b> Manasseh (Menasheh – Causing to forget) did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean (Beit-Shean – House of Rest) and its villages, or Taanach (Ta’anakh – Sandy) and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor (Dor – Dwelling) and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam (Yivle‘am – Devours the people) and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo (Megiddo – Place of Troops) and its villages; so the Canaanites persisted in living in that land.</p>

  <p><b>28</b> When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not completely drive them out.</p>

  <p><b>29</b> Ephraim (Efrayim – Fruitful) did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer (Gezer – Portion), so the Canaanites lived among them in Gezer.</p>

  <p><b>30</b> Zebulun (Zevulun – Dwelling) did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron (Kitron – Incense) or Nahalol (Nachalol – Valley), so the Canaanites lived among them and became forced laborers.</p>

  <p><b>31</b> Asher (Asher – Happy) did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco (Akko – Hot Sand), or Sidon (Tzidon – Fishery), or Ahlab (Achlav – Fatness), or Achzib (Achziv – Deceit), or Helbah (Chelbah – Fertility), or Aphik (Afik – Fortress), or Rehob (Rechov – Broad Place).</p>

  <p><b>32</b> So the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out.</p>

  <p><b>33</b> Naphtali (Naftali – My struggle) did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh (Beit-Shemesh – House of the Sun) or Beth Anath (Beit-Anat – House of Affliction), but lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. The inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath became forced labor for them.</p>

  <p><b>34</b> The Amorites (Emori – Talkers) forced the children of Dan (Dan – Judge) into the hill country, for they would not allow them to come down into the valley.</p>

  <p><b>35</b> The Amorites persisted in living in Mount Heres (Cheres – Sun), in Aijalon (Ayalon – Place of Deer), and in Shaalbim (Shaalvim – Foxes), but the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so they became forced labor.</p>

  <p><b>36</b> The border of the Amorites extended from the Ascent of Akrabbim (Ma‘aleh-Akrabbim – Ascent of Scorpions), from Sela (Sela – Rock), and upward.</p>
