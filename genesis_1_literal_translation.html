    <h1>Genesis 1 - Literal Translation</h1>

    <p class="verse"><strong>1:</strong> In the beginning, God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) created the heavens and the earth.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>2:</strong> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God (רוּחַ אֱלֹהִים, Ruach Elohim) was hovering over the face of the waters.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>3:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>4:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) saw that the light was good; and God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) divided the light from the darkness.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>5:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) called the light "Day," and the darkness He called "Night." And there was evening, and there was morning, one day.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>6:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>7:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>8:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) called the firmament "Heaven." And there was evening, and there was morning, a second day.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>9:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) said, "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear"; and it was so.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>10:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) called the dry land "Earth," and the gathering together of the waters He called "Seas." And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) saw that it was good.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>11:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth"; and it was so.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>12:</strong> And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind. And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) saw that it was good.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>13:</strong> And there was evening, and there was morning, a third day.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>14:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years,</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>15:</strong> and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth"; and it was so.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>16:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; He made the stars also.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>17:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>18:</strong> and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness; and God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) saw that it was good.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>19:</strong> And there was evening, and there was morning, a fourth day.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>20:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) said, "Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that has life, and the fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven."</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>21:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) created the great sea creatures (or great serpents) and every living soul that moves, which the waters brought forth in abundance, according to their kinds, and every bird with wings according to its kind. And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) saw that it was good.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>22:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>23:</strong> And there was evening, and there was morning, a fifth day.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>24:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) said, "Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth according to their kinds"; and it was so.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>25:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and the cattle according to their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the earth according to its kind. And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) saw that it was good.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>26:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth."</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>27:</strong> So God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) created man in His own image, in the image of God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) created He him; male and female created He them.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>28:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) blessed them, and God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) said to them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves upon the earth."</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>29:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) said, "Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>30:</strong> And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to everything that creeps upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for food." And it was so.</p>
    <p class="verse"><strong>31:</strong> And God (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day.</p>
