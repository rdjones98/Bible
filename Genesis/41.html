 He was standing by the Nile,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1198" class="text Gen-41-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat,
 and they grazed among the reeds.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1199" class="text Gen-41-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1200" class="text Gen-41-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1201" class="text Gen-41-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain,
 healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1202" class="text Gen-41-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted—thin and scorched by the east wind.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1203" class="text Gen-41-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up;
 it had been a dream.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1204" class="text Gen-41-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>In the morning his mind was troubled,
 so he sent for all the magicians
 and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1205" class="text Gen-41-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I am reminded of my shortcomings.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1206" class="text Gen-41-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Pharaoh was once angry with his servants,
 and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1207" class="text Gen-41-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1208" class="text Gen-41-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Now a young Hebrew
 was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard.
 We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1209" class="text Gen-41-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was impaled.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1210" class="text Gen-41-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon.
 When he had shaved
 and changed his clothes,
 he came before Pharaoh.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1211" class="text Gen-41-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can interpret it.
 But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1212" class="text Gen-41-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>“I cannot do it,” Joseph replied to Pharaoh, “but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1213" class="text Gen-41-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1214" class="text Gen-41-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1215" class="text Gen-41-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>After them, seven other cows came up—scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1216" class="text Gen-41-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1217" class="text Gen-41-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1218" class="text Gen-41-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>“In my dream I saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1219" class="text Gen-41-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>After them, seven other heads sprouted—withered and thin and scorched by the east wind.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1220" class="text Gen-41-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none of them could explain it to me.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1221" class="text Gen-41-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same.
 God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1222" class="text Gen-41-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>The seven good cows
 are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1223" class="text Gen-41-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1224" class="text Gen-41-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>“It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1225" class="text Gen-41-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Seven years of great abundance
 are coming throughout the land of Egypt,</span> <span id="en-NIV-1226" class="text Gen-41-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>but seven years of famine
 will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1227" class="text Gen-41-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1228" class="text Gen-41-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided
 by God, and God will do it soon.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1229" class="text Gen-41-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>“And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man
 and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1230" class="text Gen-41-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners
 over the land to take a fifth
 of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1231" class="text Gen-41-35"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1232" class="text Gen-41-36"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt,
 so that the country may not be ruined by the famine.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1233" class="text Gen-41-37"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1234" class="text Gen-41-38"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>So Pharaoh asked them, “Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1234a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1234a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1234a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>?”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1235" class="text Gen-41-39"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you,
 there is no one so discerning and wise as you.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1236" class="text Gen-41-40"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>You shall be in charge of my palace,
 and all my people are to submit to your orders.
 Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.
”</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-1237" class="text Gen-41-41">Joseph in Charge of Egypt</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-41-41"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1238" class="text Gen-41-42"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup>Then Pharaoh took his signet ring
 from his finger and put it on Joseph’s finger. He dressed him in robes
 of fine linen
 and put a gold chain around his neck.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1239" class="text Gen-41-43"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup>He had him ride in a chariot
 as his second-in-command,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1239b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1239b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1239b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>
 and people shouted before him, “Make way<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1239c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1239c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1239c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>!”
 Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1240" class="text Gen-41-44"><sup class="versenum">44 </sup>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1241" class="text Gen-41-45"><sup class="versenum">45 </sup>Pharaoh gave Joseph
 the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest
 of On,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1241d' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1241d&quot; title=&quot;See footnote d&quot;&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1241d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>
 to be his wife.
 And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1242" class="text Gen-41-46"><sup class="versenum">46 </sup>Joseph was thirty years old
 when he entered the service
 of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh’s presence and traveled throughout Egypt.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1243" class="text Gen-41-47"><sup class="versenum">47 </sup>During the seven years of abundance
 the land produced plentifully.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1244" class="text Gen-41-48"><sup class="versenum">48 </sup>Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities.
 In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1245" class="text Gen-41-49"><sup class="versenum">49 </sup>Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea;
 it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1246" class="text Gen-41-50"><sup class="versenum">50 </sup>Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1247" class="text Gen-41-51"><sup class="versenum">51 </sup>Joseph named his firstborn
 Manasseh<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1247e' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1247e&quot; title=&quot;See footnote e&quot;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1247e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup>
 and said, “It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father’s household.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-1248" class="text Gen-41-52"><sup class="versenum">52 </sup>The second son he named Ephraim<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1248f' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1248f&quot; title=&quot;See footnote f&quot;&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1248f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup>
 and said, “It is because God has made me fruitful
 in the land of my suffering.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1249" class="text Gen-41-53"><sup class="versenum">53 </sup>The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end,</span> <span id="en-NIV-1250" class="text Gen-41-54"><sup class="versenum">54 </sup>and the seven years of famine
 began,
 just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1251" class="text Gen-41-55"><sup class="versenum">55 </sup>When all Egypt began to feel the famine,
 the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1252" class="text Gen-41-56"><sup class="versenum">56 </sup>When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians,
 for the famine
 was severe throughout Egypt.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1253" class="text Gen-41-57"><sup class="versenum">57 </sup>And all the world came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph,
 because the famine was severe everywhere.
