 the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land.</span> <span id="en-NIV-983" class="text Gen-34-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>When Shechem
 son of Hamor
 the Hivite,
 the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and raped her.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-984" class="text Gen-34-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>His heart was drawn to Dinah
 daughter of Jacob;
 he loved
 the young woman and spoke tenderly
 to her.</span> <span id="en-NIV-985" class="text Gen-34-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>And Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as my wife.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-986" class="text Gen-34-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled,
 his sons were in the fields with his livestock; so he did nothing about it until they came home.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-987" class="text Gen-34-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Then Shechem’s father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-988" class="text Gen-34-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Meanwhile, Jacob’s sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were shocked
 and furious,
 because Shechem had done an outrageous thing in<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-988a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-988a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-988a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> Israel
 by sleeping with Jacob’s daughter—a thing that should not be done.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-989" class="text Gen-34-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-990" class="text Gen-34-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Intermarry with us; give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-991" class="text Gen-34-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>You can settle among us;
 the land is open to you.
 Live in it, trade<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-991b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-991b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-991b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> in it,
 and acquire property in it.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-992" class="text Gen-34-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes,
 and I will give you whatever you ask.</span> <span id="en-NIV-993" class="text Gen-34-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Make the price for the bride
 and the gift I am to bring as great as you like, and I’ll pay whatever you ask me. Only give me the young woman as my wife.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-994" class="text Gen-34-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Because their sister Dinah had been defiled,
 Jacob’s sons replied deceitfully
 as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor.</span> <span id="en-NIV-995" class="text Gen-34-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>They said to them, “We can’t do such a thing; we can’t give our sister to a man who is not circumcised.
 That would be a disgrace to us.</span> <span id="en-NIV-996" class="text Gen-34-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>We will enter into an agreement with you on one condition
 only: that you become like us by circumcising all your males.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-997" class="text Gen-34-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves.
 We’ll settle among you and become one people with you.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-998" class="text Gen-34-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>But if you will not agree to be circumcised, we’ll take our sister and go.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-999" class="text Gen-34-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1000" class="text Gen-34-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>The young man, who was the most honored
 of all his father’s family, lost no time in doing what they said, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1001" class="text Gen-34-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city
 to speak to the men of their city.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1002" class="text Gen-34-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>“These men are friendly toward us,” they said. “Let them live in our land and trade in it;
 the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1003" class="text Gen-34-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>But the men will agree to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised,
 as they themselves are.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1004" class="text Gen-34-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Won’t their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours?
 So let us agree to their terms, and they will settle among us.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1005" class="text Gen-34-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>All the men who went out of the city gate
 agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1006" class="text Gen-34-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Three days later, while all of them were still in pain,
 two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon
 and Levi,
 Dinah’s brothers, took their swords
 and attacked the unsuspecting city,
 killing every male.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1007" class="text Gen-34-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword
 and took Dinah
 from Shechem’s house and left.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1008" class="text Gen-34-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city
 where<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1008c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1008c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1008c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> their sister had been defiled.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1009" class="text Gen-34-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys
 and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1010" class="text Gen-34-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children,
 taking as plunder
 everything in the houses.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1011" class="text Gen-34-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble
 on me by making me obnoxious
 to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land.
 We are few in number,
 and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1012" class="text Gen-34-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>But they replied, “Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?
