 near the great trees of Mamre
 while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent
 in the heat of the day.</span> <span id="en-NIV-427" class="text Gen-18-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Abraham looked up
 and saw three men
 standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-428" class="text Gen-18-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>He said, “If I have found favor in your eyes,
 my lord,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-428a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-428a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-428a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> do not pass your servant
 by.</span> <span id="en-NIV-429" class="text Gen-18-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet
 and rest under this tree.</span> <span id="en-NIV-430" class="text Gen-18-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Let me get you something to eat,
 so you can be refreshed and then go on your way—now that you have come to your servant.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-5">“Very well,” they answered, “do as you say.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-431" class="text Gen-18-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. “Quick,” he said, “get three seahs<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-431b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-431b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-431b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> of the finest flour and knead it and bake some bread.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-432" class="text Gen-18-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf
 and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.</span> <span id="en-NIV-433" class="text Gen-18-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>He then brought some curds
 and milk
 and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them.
 While they ate, he stood near them under a tree.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-434" class="text Gen-18-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>“Where is your wife Sarah?”
 they asked him.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-9">“There, in the tent,
” he said.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-435" class="text Gen-18-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Then one of them said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year,
 and Sarah your wife will have a son.”
</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-10">Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him.</span> <span id="en-NIV-436" class="text Gen-18-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Abraham and Sarah were already very old,
 and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-437" class="text Gen-18-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>So Sarah laughed
 to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my lord
 is old, will I now have this pleasure?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-438" class="text Gen-18-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I really have a child, now that I am old?’
</span> <span id="en-NIV-439" class="text Gen-18-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Is anything too hard for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>?
 I will return to you at the appointed time next year,
 and Sarah will have a son.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-440" class="text Gen-18-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-15">But he said, “Yes, you did laugh.”</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-441" class="text Gen-18-16">Abraham Pleads for Sodom</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-18-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>When the men
 got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way.</span> <span id="en-NIV-442" class="text Gen-18-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Shall I hide from Abraham
 what I am about to do?
</span> <span id="en-NIV-443" class="text Gen-18-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation,
 and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-443c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-443c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-443c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup></span> <span id="en-NIV-444" class="text Gen-18-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>For I have chosen him
, so that he will direct his children
 and his household after him to keep the way of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>
 by doing what is right and just,
 so that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-445" class="text Gen-18-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “The outcry against Sodom
 and Gomorrah is so great
 and their sin so grievous
</span> <span id="en-NIV-446" class="text Gen-18-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>that I will go down
 and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-447" class="text Gen-18-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>The men
 turned away and went toward Sodom,
 but Abraham remained standing before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-447d' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-447d&quot; title=&quot;See footnote d&quot;&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-447d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>
</span> <span id="en-NIV-448" class="text Gen-18-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Then Abraham approached him and said: “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
</span> <span id="en-NIV-449" class="text Gen-18-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-449e' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-449e&quot; title=&quot;See footnote e&quot;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-449e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it?
</span> <span id="en-NIV-450" class="text Gen-18-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Far be it from you to do such a thing
—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous
 and the wicked alike.
 Far be it from you! Will not the Judge
 of all the earth do right?”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-451" class="text Gen-18-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-452" class="text Gen-18-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Then Abraham spoke up again: “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-453" class="text Gen-18-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five people?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-28">“If I find forty-five there,” he said, “I will not destroy it.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-454" class="text Gen-18-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Once again he spoke to him, “What if only forty are found there?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-29">He said, “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-455" class="text Gen-18-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry,
 but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-30">He answered, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-456" class="text Gen-18-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Abraham said, “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-31">He said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-457" class="text Gen-18-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more.
 What if only ten can be found there?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-32">He answered, “For the sake of ten,
 I will not destroy it.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-458" class="text Gen-18-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>When the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had finished speaking
 with Abraham, he left,
 and Abraham returned home.
