 so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two female servants.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-963" class="text Gen-33-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>He put the female servants and their children
 in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph
 in the rear.</span> <span id="en-NIV-964" class="text Gen-33-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground
 seven times
 as he approached his brother.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-965" class="text Gen-33-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But Esau
 ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him.
 And they wept.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-966" class="text Gen-33-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. “Who are these with you?” he asked.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-33-5">Jacob answered, “They are the children God has graciously given your servant.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-967" class="text Gen-33-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Then the female servants and their children
 approached and bowed down.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-968" class="text Gen-33-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Next, Leah and her children
 came and bowed down.
 Last of all came Joseph and Rachel,
 and they too bowed down.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-969" class="text Gen-33-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Esau asked, “What’s the meaning of all these flocks and herds I met?”
</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-33-8">“To find favor in your eyes, my lord,”
 he said.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-970" class="text Gen-33-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>But Esau said, “I already have plenty,
 my brother. Keep what you have for yourself.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-971" class="text Gen-33-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>“No, please!” said Jacob. “If I have found favor in your eyes,
 accept this gift
 from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God,
 now that you have received me favorably.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-972" class="text Gen-33-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Please accept the present
 that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me
 and I have all I need.”
 And because Jacob insisted,
 Esau accepted it.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-973" class="text Gen-33-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way; I’ll accompany you.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-974" class="text Gen-33-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>But Jacob said to him, “My lord
 knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young.
 If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.</span> <span id="en-NIV-975" class="text Gen-33-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds
 before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-976" class="text Gen-33-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Esau said, “Then let me leave some of my men with you.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-33-15">“But why do that?” Jacob asked. “Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-977" class="text Gen-33-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-978" class="text Gen-33-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Jacob, however, went to Sukkoth,
 where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock.
