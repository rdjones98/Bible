<div class='std-text'> <h3><span id="en-NIV-1360" class="text Gen-45-1">Joseph Makes Himself Known</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-45-1"><span class="chapternum">45 </span>Then Joseph could no longer control himself
 before all his attendants, and he cried out, “Have everyone leave my presence!”
 So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1361" class="text Gen-45-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>And he wept
 so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh’s household heard about it.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1362" class="text Gen-45-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still living?”
 But his brothers were not able to answer him,
 because they were terrified at his presence.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1363" class="text Gen-45-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come close to me.”
 When they had done so, he said, “I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt!
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1364" class="text Gen-45-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>And now, do not be distressed
 and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here,
 because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1365" class="text Gen-45-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>For two years now there has been famine
 in the land, and for the next five years there will be no plowing and reaping.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1366" class="text Gen-45-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant
 on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1366a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1366a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1366a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1367" class="text Gen-45-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>“So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God.
 He made me father
 to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1368" class="text Gen-45-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Now hurry
 back to my father and say to him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; don’t delay.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1369" class="text Gen-45-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>You shall live in the region of Goshen
 and be near me—you, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all you have.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1370" class="text Gen-45-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>I will provide for you there,
 because five years of famine
 are still to come. Otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute.’
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1371" class="text Gen-45-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>“You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin,
 that it is really I who am speaking to you.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1372" class="text Gen-45-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Tell my father about all the honor accorded me in Egypt
 and about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1373" class="text Gen-45-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin
 embraced him,
 weeping.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1374" class="text Gen-45-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>And he kissed
 all his brothers and wept over them.
 Afterward his brothers talked with him.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1375" class="text Gen-45-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>When the news reached Pharaoh’s palace that Joseph’s brothers had come,
 Pharaoh and all his officials
 were pleased.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1376" class="text Gen-45-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals
 and return to the land of Canaan,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1377" class="text Gen-45-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>and bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt
 and you can enjoy the fat of the land.’
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1378" class="text Gen-45-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>“You are also directed to tell them, ‘Do this: Take some carts
 from Egypt for your children and your wives, and get your father and come.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1379" class="text Gen-45-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Never mind about your belongings,
 because the best of all Egypt
 will be yours.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1380" class="text Gen-45-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts,
 as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also gave them provisions for their journey.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1381" class="text Gen-45-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>To each of them he gave new clothing,
 but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1381b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1381b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1381b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup> of silver and five sets of clothes.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1382" class="text Gen-45-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>And this is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys
 loaded with the best things
 of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1383" class="text Gen-45-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were leaving he said to them, “Don’t quarrel on the way!”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1384" class="text Gen-45-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>So they went up out of Egypt
 and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1385" class="text Gen-45-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>They told him, “Joseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all Egypt.”
 Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1386" class="text Gen-45-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts
 Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1387" class="text Gen-45-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>And Israel said, “I’m convinced!
 My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”
