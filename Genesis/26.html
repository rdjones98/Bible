</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-26-1"><span class="chapternum">26 </span>Now there was a famine in the land
—besides the previous famine in Abraham’s time—and Isaac went to Abimelek king of the Philistines
 in Gerar.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-695" class="text Gen-26-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared
 to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt;
 live in the land where I tell you to live.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-696" class="text Gen-26-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Stay in this land for a while,
 and I will be with you
 and will bless you.
 For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands
 and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-697" class="text Gen-26-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>I will make your descendants
 as numerous as the stars in the sky
 and will give them all these lands,
 and through your offspring<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-697a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-697a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-697a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> all nations on earth will be blessed,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-697b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-697b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-697b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>
</span> <span id="en-NIV-698" class="text Gen-26-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>because Abraham obeyed me
 and did everything I required of him, keeping my commands, my decrees
 and my instructions.
”</span> <span id="en-NIV-699" class="text Gen-26-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>So Isaac stayed in Gerar.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-700" class="text Gen-26-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,
” because he was afraid to say, “She is my wife.” He thought, “The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-701" class="text Gen-26-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelek king of the Philistines
 looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.</span> <span id="en-NIV-702" class="text Gen-26-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>So Abimelek summoned Isaac and said, “She is really your wife! Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?
”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-26-9">Isaac answered him, “Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-703" class="text Gen-26-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Then Abimelek said, “What is this you have done to us?
 One of the men might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-704" class="text Gen-26-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>So Abimelek gave orders to all the people: “Anyone who harms
 this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-705" class="text Gen-26-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold,
 because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> blessed him.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-706" class="text Gen-26-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-707" class="text Gen-26-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>He had so many flocks and herds and servants
 that the Philistines envied him.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-708" class="text Gen-26-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>So all the wells
 that his father’s servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up,
 filling them with earth.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-709" class="text Gen-26-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Then Abimelek said to Isaac, “Move away from us;
 you have become too powerful for us.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-710" class="text Gen-26-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar,
 where he settled.</span> <span id="en-NIV-711" class="text Gen-26-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Isaac reopened the wells
 that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-712" class="text Gen-26-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there.</span> <span id="en-NIV-713" class="text Gen-26-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>But the herders of Gerar quarreled
 with those of Isaac and said, “The water is ours!”
 So he named the well Esek,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-713c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-713c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-713c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> because they disputed with him.</span> <span id="en-NIV-714" class="text Gen-26-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Then they dug another well, but they quarreled
 over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-714d' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-714d&quot; title=&quot;See footnote d&quot;&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-714d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup></span> <span id="en-NIV-715" class="text Gen-26-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-715e' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-715e&quot; title=&quot;See footnote e&quot;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-715e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup>
 saying, “Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has given us room
 and we will flourish
 in the land.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-716" class="text Gen-26-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>From there he went up to Beersheba.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-717" class="text Gen-26-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>That night the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham.
 Do not be afraid,
 for I am with you;
 I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants
 for the sake of my servant Abraham.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-718" class="text Gen-26-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Isaac built an altar
 there and called on the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.
 There he pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-719" class="text Gen-26-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Meanwhile, Abimelek had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-720" class="text Gen-26-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-721" class="text Gen-26-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>They answered, “We saw clearly that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was with you;
 so we said, ‘There ought to be a sworn agreement between us’—between us and you. Let us make a treaty
 with you</span> <span id="en-NIV-722" class="text Gen-26-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>that you will do us no harm,
 just as we did not harm you but always treated you well and sent you away peacefully. And now you are blessed by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-723" class="text Gen-26-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Isaac then made a feast
 for them, and they ate and drank.</span> <span id="en-NIV-724" class="text Gen-26-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Early the next morning the men swore an oath
 to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they went away peacefully.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-725" class="text Gen-26-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>That day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well
 they had dug. They said, “We’ve found water!”</span> <span id="en-NIV-726" class="text Gen-26-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>He called it Shibah,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-726f' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-726f&quot; title=&quot;See footnote f&quot;&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-726f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> and to this day the name of the town has been Beersheba.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-726g' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-726g&quot; title=&quot;See footnote g&quot;&gt;g&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-726g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup>
