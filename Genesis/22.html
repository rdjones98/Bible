 Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-22-1">“Here I am,”
 he replied.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-550" class="text Gen-22-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Then God said, “Take your son
, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah.
 Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering
 on a mountain I will show you.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-551" class="text Gen-22-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Early the next morning
 Abraham got up and loaded his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about.</span> <span id="en-NIV-552" class="text Gen-22-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.</span> <span id="en-NIV-553" class="text Gen-22-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>He said to his servants, “Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-554" class="text Gen-22-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac,
 and he himself carried the fire and the knife.
 As the two of them went on together,</span> <span id="en-NIV-555" class="text Gen-22-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, “Father?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-22-7">“Yes, my son?” Abraham replied.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-22-7">“The fire and wood are here,” Isaac said, “but where is the lamb
 for the burnt offering?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-556" class="text Gen-22-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Abraham answered, “God himself will provide
 the lamb
 for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them went on together.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-557" class="text Gen-22-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>When they reached the place God had told him about,
 Abraham built an altar
 there and arranged the wood
 on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar,
 on top of the wood.</span> <span id="en-NIV-558" class="text Gen-22-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Then he reached out his hand and took the knife
 to slay his son.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-559" class="text Gen-22-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>But the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>
 called out to him from heaven,
 “Abraham! Abraham!”
</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-22-11">“Here I am,”
 he replied.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-560" class="text Gen-22-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>“Do not lay a hand on the boy,” he said. “Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God,
 because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-561" class="text Gen-22-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-561a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-561a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-561a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> caught by its horns.
 He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-562" class="text Gen-22-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>So Abraham called
 that place The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>
 Will Provide. And to this day it is said, “On the mountain of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> it will be provided.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-563" class="text Gen-22-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>The angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>
 called to Abraham from heaven
 a second time</span> <span id="en-NIV-564" class="text Gen-22-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>and said, “I swear by myself,
 declares the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,

 and make your descendants

 because you have obeyed me.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-567" class="text Gen-22-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba.
 And Abraham stayed in Beersheba.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-568" class="text Gen-22-20">Nahor’s Sons</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-22-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Some time later Abraham was told, “Milkah is also a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor:

”</span> <span id="en-NIV-571" class="text Gen-22-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Bethuel became the father of Rebekah.
 Milkah bore these eight sons to Abraham’s brother Nahor.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-572" class="text Gen-22-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>His concubine,
 whose name was Reumah, also had sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash and Maakah.</span></p> </div><div class='il-text'></div><div class="footnotes">
