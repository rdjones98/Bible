<div class='std-text'> <h3><span id="en-NIV-1326" class="text Gen-44-1">A Silver Cup in a Sack</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-44-1"><span class="chapternum">44 </span>Now Joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house:
 “Fill the men’s sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man’s silver in the mouth of his sack.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1327" class="text Gen-44-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Then put my cup,
 the silver one,
 in the mouth of the youngest one’s sack, along with the silver for his grain.” And he did as Joseph said.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1328" class="text Gen-44-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>As morning dawned, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1329" class="text Gen-44-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward,
 “Go after those men at once, and when you catch up with them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil?
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1330" class="text Gen-44-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Isn’t this the cup
 my master drinks from and also uses for divination?
 This is a wicked thing you have done.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1331" class="text Gen-44-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1332" class="text Gen-44-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>But they said to him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants
 to do anything like that!
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1333" class="text Gen-44-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan
 the silver
 we found inside the mouths of our sacks.
 So why would we steal
 silver or gold from your master’s house?</span> <span id="en-NIV-1334" class="text Gen-44-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>If any of your servants
 is found to have it, he will die;
 and the rest of us will become my lord’s slaves.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1335" class="text Gen-44-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>“Very well, then,” he said, “let it be as you say. Whoever is found to have it
 will become my slave;
 the rest of you will be free from blame.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1336" class="text Gen-44-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1337" class="text Gen-44-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Then the steward
 proceeded to search,
 beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest.
 And the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1338" class="text Gen-44-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>At this, they tore their clothes.
 Then they all loaded their donkeys
 and returned to the city.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1339" class="text Gen-44-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Joseph was still in the house
 when Judah
 and his brothers came in, and they threw themselves to the ground before him.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1340" class="text Gen-44-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Joseph said to them, “What is this you have done?
 Don’t you know that a man like me can find things out by divination?
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1341" class="text Gen-44-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>“What can we say to my lord?
” Judah
 replied. “What can we say? How can we prove our innocence?
 God has uncovered your servants’
 guilt. We are now my lord’s slaves
—we ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1342" class="text Gen-44-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>But Joseph said, “Far be it from me to do such a thing!
 Only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave.
 The rest of you, go back to your father in peace.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1343" class="text Gen-44-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Then Judah
 went up to him and said: “Pardon your servant, my lord,
 let me speak a word to my lord. Do not be angry
 with your servant, though you are equal to Pharaoh himself.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1344" class="text Gen-44-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>My lord asked his servants,
 ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1345" class="text Gen-44-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>And we answered, ‘We have an aged father, and there is a young son born to him in his old age.
 His brother is dead,
 and he is the only one of his mother’s sons left, and his father loves him.’
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1346" class="text Gen-44-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>“Then you said to your servants,
 ‘Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.’
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1347" class="text Gen-44-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>And we said to my lord,
 ‘The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves him, his father will die.’
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1348" class="text Gen-44-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>But you told your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.’
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1349" class="text Gen-44-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>When we went back to your servant my father,
 we told him what my lord
 had said.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1350" class="text Gen-44-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>“Then our father said, ‘Go back and buy a little more food.’
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1351" class="text Gen-44-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>But we said, ‘We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1352" class="text Gen-44-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>“Your servant my father
 said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1353" class="text Gen-44-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>One of them went away from me, and I said, “He has surely been torn to pieces.”
 And I have not seen him since.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1354" class="text Gen-44-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave
 in misery.’
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1355" class="text Gen-44-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>“So now, if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father,
 and if my father, whose life is closely bound up with the boy’s life,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1356" class="text Gen-44-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>sees that the boy isn’t there, he will die.
 Your servants
 will bring the gray head of our father down to the grave
 in sorrow.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1357" class="text Gen-44-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Your servant guaranteed the boy’s safety to my father. I said, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father, all my life!’
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1358" class="text Gen-44-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>“Now then, please let your servant remain here as my lord’s slave
 in place of the boy,
 and let the boy return with his brothers.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1359" class="text Gen-44-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see the misery
 that would come on my father.”
