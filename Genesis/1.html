 God <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elohim>Elohim</a> created
 the heavens
 and the earth.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-2" class="text Gen-1-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Now the earth was formless
 and empty,
 darkness was over the surface of the deep,
 and the Spirit of God
 was hovering
 over the waters.</span></p></div> <div class="list top-05"><p class="hang-2"><span id="en-NIV-3" class="text Gen-1-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>And God said,
 “Let there be light,” and there was light.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-4" class="text Gen-1-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>God saw that the light was good,
 and he separated the light from the darkness.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-5" class="text Gen-1-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>God called
 the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.”
 And there was evening, and there was morning
—the first day.</span></p> <p class="hang-2"><span id="en-NIV-6" class="text Gen-1-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>And God said,
 “Let there be a vault
 between the waters
 to separate water from water.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-7" class="text Gen-1-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it.
 And it was so.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-8" class="text Gen-1-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>God called
 the vault “sky.”
 And there was evening, and there was morning
—the second day.</span></p> <p class="hang-2"><span id="en-NIV-9" class="text Gen-1-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place,
 and let dry ground
 appear.” And it was so.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-10" class="text Gen-1-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>God called
 the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters
 he called “seas.”
 And God saw that it was good.
</span></p> <p class="left-2 first-line-1"><span id="en-NIV-11" class="text Gen-1-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation:
 seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.
” And it was so.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-12" class="text Gen-1-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds
 and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-13" class="text Gen-1-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>And there was evening, and there was morning
—the third day.</span></p> <p class="hang-2"><span id="en-NIV-14" class="text Gen-1-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>And God said, “Let there be lights
 in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night,
 and let them serve as signs
 to mark sacred times,
 and days and years,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-15" class="text Gen-1-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-16" class="text Gen-1-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>God made two great lights—the greater light
 to govern
 the day and the lesser light to govern
 the night.
 He also made the stars.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-17" class="text Gen-1-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth,</span> <span id="en-NIV-18" class="text Gen-1-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>to govern the day and the night,
 and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-19" class="text Gen-1-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>And there was evening, and there was morning
—the fourth day.</span></p> <p class="hang-2"><span id="en-NIV-20" class="text Gen-1-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures,
 and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-21" class="text Gen-1-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>So God created
 the great creatures of the sea
 and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it,
 according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind.
 And God saw that it was good.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-22" class="text Gen-1-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-23" class="text Gen-1-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>And there was evening, and there was morning
—the fifth day.</span></p> <p class="hang-2"><span id="en-NIV-24" class="text Gen-1-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures
 according to their kinds:
 the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-25" class="text Gen-1-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>God made the wild animals
 according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds.
 And God saw that it was good.
</span></p> <p class="left-2 first-line-1"><span id="en-NIV-26" class="text Gen-1-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Then God said, “Let us
 make mankind
 in our image,

 he created them;</span></span><br /><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text Gen-1-27">male and female

” And it was so.</span></p> <p class="left-2 first-line-1"><span id="en-NIV-31" class="text Gen-1-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>God saw all that he had made,
 and it was very good.
 And there was evening, and there was morning
—the sixth day.</span></p></div> </div><div class='il-text'></div><div class="footnotes">
