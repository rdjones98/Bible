</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-20-1"><span class="chapternum">20 </span>Now Abraham moved on from there
 into the region of the Negev
 and lived between Kadesh
 and Shur.
 For a while
 he stayed in Gerar,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-498" class="text Gen-20-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.
” Then Abimelek
 king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-499" class="text Gen-20-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>But God came to Abimelek
 in a dream
 one night and said to him, “You are as good as dead
 because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-500" class="text Gen-20-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Now Abimelek had not gone near her, so he said, “Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?
</span> <span id="en-NIV-501" class="text Gen-20-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister,
’ and didn’t she also say, ‘He is my brother’? I have done this with a clear conscience
 and clean hands.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-502" class="text Gen-20-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept
 you from sinning against me.
 That is why I did not let you touch her.</span> <span id="en-NIV-503" class="text Gen-20-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet,
 and he will pray for you
 and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all who belong to you will die.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-504" class="text Gen-20-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Early the next morning Abimelek summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid.</span> <span id="en-NIV-505" class="text Gen-20-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Then Abimelek called Abraham in and said, “What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done.
”</span> <span id="en-NIV-506" class="text Gen-20-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>And Abimelek asked Abraham, “What was your reason for doing this?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-507" class="text Gen-20-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Abraham replied, “I said to myself, ‘There is surely no fear of God
 in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’
</span> <span id="en-NIV-508" class="text Gen-20-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Besides, she really is my sister,
 the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife.</span> <span id="en-NIV-509" class="text Gen-20-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>And when God had me wander
 from my father’s household,
 I said to her, ‘This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-510" class="text Gen-20-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Then Abimelek
 brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham,
 and he returned Sarah his wife to him.</span> <span id="en-NIV-511" class="text Gen-20-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>And Abimelek said, “My land is before you; live wherever you like.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-512" class="text Gen-20-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>To Sarah he said, “I am giving your brother a thousand shekels<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-512a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-512a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-512a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> of silver.
