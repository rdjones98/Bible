<div class='std-text'> <h3><span id="en-NIV-1121" class="text Gen-38-1">Judah and Tamar</span></h3><p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-38-1"><span class="chapternum">38 </span>At that time, Judah
 left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam
 named Hirah.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1122" class="text Gen-38-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua.
 He married her and made love to her;</span> <span id="en-NIV-1123" class="text Gen-38-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1124" class="text Gen-38-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1125" class="text Gen-38-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah.
 It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1126" class="text Gen-38-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1127" class="text Gen-38-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s sight;
 so the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> put him to death.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1128" class="text Gen-38-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Then Judah said to Onan, “Sleep with your brother’s wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your brother.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1129" class="text Gen-38-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1130" class="text Gen-38-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>What he did was wicked in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s sight; so the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> put him to death also.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1131" class="text Gen-38-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Judah then said to his daughter-in-law
 Tamar,
 “Live as a widow in your father’s household
 until my son Shelah
 grows up.”
 For he thought, “He may die too, just like his brothers.” So Tamar went to live in her father’s household.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1132" class="text Gen-38-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>After a long time Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua,
 died. When Judah had recovered from his grief, he went up to Timnah,
 to the men who were shearing his sheep,
 and his friend Hirah the Adullamite
 went with him.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1133" class="text Gen-38-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>When Tamar
 was told, “Your father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep,”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1134" class="text Gen-38-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>she took off her widow’s clothes,
 covered herself with a veil
 to disguise herself, and then sat down
 at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah.
 For she saw that, though Shelah
 had now grown up, she had not been given to him as his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1135" class="text Gen-38-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute,
 for she had covered her face.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1136" class="text Gen-38-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Not realizing
 that she was his daughter-in-law,
 he went over to her by the roadside and said, “Come now, let me sleep with you.”
</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-38-16">“And what will you give me to sleep with you?”
 she asked.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1137" class="text Gen-38-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>“I’ll send you a young goat
 from my flock,” he said.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-38-17">“Will you give me something as a pledge
 until you send it?” she asked.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1138" class="text Gen-38-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>He said, “What pledge should I give you?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-38-18">“Your seal
 and its cord, and the staff
 in your hand,” she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1139" class="text Gen-38-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow’s clothes
 again.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1140" class="text Gen-38-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite
 in order to get his pledge
 back from the woman, but he did not find her.</span> <span id="en-NIV-1141" class="text Gen-38-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>He asked the men who lived there, “Where is the shrine prostitute
 who was beside the road at Enaim?”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-38-21">“There hasn’t been any shrine prostitute here,” they said.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1142" class="text Gen-38-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>So he went back to Judah and said, “I didn’t find her. Besides, the men who lived there said, ‘There hasn’t been any shrine prostitute here.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1143" class="text Gen-38-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Then Judah said, “Let her keep what she has,
 or we will become a laughingstock.
 After all, I did send her this young goat, but you didn’t find her.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1144" class="text Gen-38-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>About three months later Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-38-24">Judah said, “Bring her out and have her burned to death!”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1145" class="text Gen-38-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. “I am pregnant by the man who owns these,” she said. And she added, “See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1146" class="text Gen-38-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Judah recognized them and said, “She is more righteous than I,
 since I wouldn’t give her to my son Shelah.
” And he did not sleep with her again.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-1147" class="text Gen-38-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1148" class="text Gen-38-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife
 took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist
 and said, “This one came out first.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-1149" class="text Gen-38-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out,
 and she said, “So this is how you have broken out!” And he was named Perez.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1149a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1149a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1149a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>
</span> <span id="en-NIV-1150" class="text Gen-38-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist,
 came out. And he was named Zerah.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-1150b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-1150b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-1150b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>
