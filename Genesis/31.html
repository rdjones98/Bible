 were saying, “Jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-876" class="text Gen-31-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>And Jacob noticed that Laban’s attitude toward him was not what it had been.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-877" class="text Gen-31-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Jacob, “Go back
 to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-878" class="text Gen-31-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were.</span> <span id="en-NIV-879" class="text Gen-31-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>He said to them, “I see that your father’s
 attitude toward me is not what it was before,
 but the God of my father has been with me.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-880" class="text Gen-31-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>You know that I’ve worked for your father with all my strength,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-881" class="text Gen-31-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>yet your father has cheated
 me by changing my wages
 ten times.
 However, God has not allowed him to harm me.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-882" class="text Gen-31-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>If he said, ‘The speckled ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, ‘The streaked ones will be your wages,’
 then all the flocks bore streaked young.</span> <span id="en-NIV-883" class="text Gen-31-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>So God has taken away your father’s livestock
 and has given them to me.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-884" class="text Gen-31-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>“In breeding season I once had a dream
 in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted.</span> <span id="en-NIV-885" class="text Gen-31-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>The angel of God
 said to me in the dream,
 ‘Jacob.’ I answered, ‘Here I am.’
</span> <span id="en-NIV-886" class="text Gen-31-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>And he said, ‘Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted,
 for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-887" class="text Gen-31-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>I am the God of Bethel,
 where you anointed a pillar
 and where you made a vow
 to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.
’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-888" class="text Gen-31-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Then Rachel and Leah replied, “Do we still have any share
 in the inheritance of our father’s estate?</span> <span id="en-NIV-889" class="text Gen-31-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Does he not regard us as foreigners?
 Not only has he sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-890" class="text Gen-31-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children.
 So do whatever God has told you.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-891" class="text Gen-31-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Then Jacob put his children and his wives
 on camels,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-892" class="text Gen-31-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated
 in Paddan Aram,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-892a' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-892a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-892a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup>
 to go to his father Isaac
 in the land of Canaan.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-893" class="text Gen-31-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>When Laban had gone to shear his sheep,
 Rachel stole her father’s household gods.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-894" class="text Gen-31-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Moreover, Jacob deceived
 Laban the Aramean
 by not telling him he was running away.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-895" class="text Gen-31-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>So he fled
 with all he had, crossed the Euphrates River,
 and headed for the hill country of Gilead.
</span></p> <h3><span id="en-NIV-896" class="text Gen-31-22">Laban Pursues Jacob</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-31-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>On the third day
 Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-897" class="text Gen-31-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Taking his relatives
 with him
, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-898" class="text Gen-31-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>Then God came to Laban the Aramean
 in a dream at night and said to him,
 “Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-899" class="text Gen-31-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead
 when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there too.</span> <span id="en-NIV-900" class="text Gen-31-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done?
 You’ve deceived me,
 and you’ve carried off my daughters like captives in war.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-901" class="text Gen-31-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn’t you tell me,
 so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of timbrels
 and harps?
</span> <span id="en-NIV-902" class="text Gen-31-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>You didn’t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye.
 You have done a foolish thing.</span> <span id="en-NIV-903" class="text Gen-31-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>I have the power to harm you;
 but last night the God of your father
 said to me, ‘Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.’
</span> <span id="en-NIV-904" class="text Gen-31-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father’s household.
 But why did you steal
 my gods?
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-905" class="text Gen-31-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Jacob answered Laban, “I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-906" class="text Gen-31-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>But if you find anyone who has your gods, that person shall not live.
 In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-907" class="text Gen-31-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent
 and into the tent of the two female servants,
 but he found nothing.
 After he came out of Leah’s tent, he entered Rachel’s tent.</span> <span id="en-NIV-908" class="text Gen-31-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>Now Rachel had taken the household gods
 and put them inside her camel’s saddle
 and was sitting on them. Laban searched
 through everything in the tent but found nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-909" class="text Gen-31-35"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>Rachel said to her father, “Don’t be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence;
 I’m having my period.
” So he searched but could not find the household gods.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-910" class="text Gen-31-36"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. “What is my crime?” he asked Laban. “How have I wronged
 you that you hunt me down?
</span> <span id="en-NIV-911" class="text Gen-31-37"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household?
 Put it here in front of your relatives
 and mine, and let them judge between the two of us.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-912" class="text Gen-31-38"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>“I have been with you for twenty years now.
 Your sheep and goats have not miscarried,
 nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.</span> <span id="en-NIV-913" class="text Gen-31-39"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen
 by day or night.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-914" class="text Gen-31-40"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-915" class="text Gen-31-41"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>It was like this for the twenty years
 I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters
 and six years for your flocks,
 and you changed my wages
 ten times.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-916" class="text Gen-31-42"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup>If the God of my father,
 the God of Abraham
 and the Fear of Isaac,
 had not been with me,
 you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands,
 and last night he rebuked you.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-917" class="text Gen-31-43"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup>Laban answered Jacob, “The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks.
 All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne?</span> <span id="en-NIV-918" class="text Gen-31-44"><sup class="versenum">44 </sup>Come now, let’s make a covenant,
 you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-919" class="text Gen-31-45"><sup class="versenum">45 </sup>So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-920" class="text Gen-31-46"><sup class="versenum">46 </sup>He said to his relatives, “Gather some stones.” So they took stones and piled them in a heap,
 and they ate there by the heap.</span> <span id="en-NIV-921" class="text Gen-31-47"><sup class="versenum">47 </sup>Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-921b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-921b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-921b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-922" class="text Gen-31-48"><sup class="versenum">48 </sup>Laban said, “This heap
 is a witness between you and me today.”
 That is why it was called Galeed.</span> <span id="en-NIV-923" class="text Gen-31-49"><sup class="versenum">49 </sup>It was also called Mizpah,<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-923c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-923c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-923c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup>
 because he said, “May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other.</span> <span id="en-NIV-924" class="text Gen-31-50"><sup class="versenum">50 </sup>If you mistreat
 my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness
 between you and me.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-925" class="text Gen-31-51"><sup class="versenum">51 </sup>Laban also said to Jacob, “Here is this heap,
 and here is this pillar
 I have set up between you and me.</span> <span id="en-NIV-926" class="text Gen-31-52"><sup class="versenum">52 </sup>This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness,
 that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap
 and pillar to my side to harm me.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-927" class="text Gen-31-53"><sup class="versenum">53 </sup>May the God of Abraham
 and the God of Nahor,
 the God of their father, judge between us.”
</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-31-53">So Jacob took an oath
 in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-928" class="text Gen-31-54"><sup class="versenum">54 </sup>He offered a sacrifice
 there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal.
 After they had eaten, they spent the night there.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-929" class="text Gen-31-55"><sup class="versenum">55 </sup>Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters
 and blessed
 them. Then he left and returned home.<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-929d' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-929d&quot; title=&quot;See footnote d&quot;&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-929d" title="See footnote d">d</a>]</sup>
