 him in every way.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-594" class="text Gen-24-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>He said to the senior servant
 in his household, the one in charge of all that he had,
 “Put your hand under my thigh.

 by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of heaven

 and get a wife for my son Isaac.
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-597" class="text Gen-24-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>The servant asked him, “What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land?
 Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?
”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-598" class="text Gen-24-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>“Make sure that you do not take my son back there,”
 Abraham said.</span> <span id="en-NIV-599" class="text Gen-24-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>“The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of heaven,
 who brought me out of my father’s household and my native land

 of mine. Only do not take my son back there.”
</span> <span id="en-NIV-601" class="text Gen-24-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>So the servant put his hand under the thigh
 of his master
 Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-602" class="text Gen-24-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Then the servant left, taking with him ten of his master’s camels
 loaded with all kinds of good things
 from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-602b' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-602b&quot; title=&quot;See footnote b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-602b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]</sup>
 and made his way to the town of Nahor.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-603" class="text Gen-24-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>He had the camels kneel down near the well
 outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-604" class="text Gen-24-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Then he prayed, “<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, God of my master Abraham,
 make me successful
 today, and show kindness
 to my master Abraham.</span> <span id="en-NIV-605" class="text Gen-24-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-606" class="text Gen-24-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>May it be that when I say to a young woman, ‘Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink,
 and I’ll water your camels too’
—let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac.
 By this I will know
 that you have shown kindness to my master.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-607" class="text Gen-24-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Before he had finished praying,
 Rebekah
 came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel
 son of Milkah,
 who was the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-608" class="text Gen-24-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>The woman was very beautiful,
 a virgin;
 no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-609" class="text Gen-24-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>The servant hurried to meet her and said, “Please give me a little water from your jar.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-610" class="text Gen-24-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>“Drink,
 my lord,” she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-611" class="text Gen-24-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>After she had given him a drink, she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels
 too,
 until they have had enough to drink.”</span> <span id="en-NIV-612" class="text Gen-24-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-613" class="text Gen-24-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had made his journey successful.
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-614" class="text Gen-24-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring
 weighing a beka<sup data-fn='#fen-NIV-614c' class='footnote' data-link='[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NIV-614c&quot; title=&quot;See footnote c&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-NIV-614c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]</sup> and two gold bracelets

”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-616" class="text Gen-24-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>She answered him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milkah bore to Nahor.
”</span> <span id="en-NIV-617" class="text Gen-24-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>And she added, “We have plenty of straw and fodder,
 as well as room for you to spend the night.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-618" class="text Gen-24-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Then the man bowed down and worshiped the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,
</span> <span id="en-NIV-619" class="text Gen-24-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>saying, “Praise be to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,
 the God of my master Abraham,
 who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness
 to my master. As for me, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has led me on the journey
 to the house of my master’s relatives.”
</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-620" class="text Gen-24-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>The young woman ran and told her mother’s household about these things.

 and he hurried out to the man at the spring.</span> <span id="en-NIV-622" class="text Gen-24-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s arms,
 and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring.</span> <span id="en-NIV-623" class="text Gen-24-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>“Come, you who are blessed by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,”
 he said. “Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-624" class="text Gen-24-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder
 were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-625" class="text Gen-24-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>Then food was set before him, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-24-33">“Then tell us,” Laban said.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-626" class="text Gen-24-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant.

 my master abundantly,

 If a young woman
 comes out to draw water and I say to her, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar,”

 Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder.

 I praised the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of my master Abraham,

 answered, “This is from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>;
