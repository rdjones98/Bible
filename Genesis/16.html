 Abram’s wife, had borne him no children.
 But she had an Egyptian slave
 named Hagar;
</span> <span id="en-NIV-384" class="text Gen-16-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>so she said to Abram, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has kept me from having children.
 Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her.”
</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-16-2">Abram agreed to what Sarai said.</span> <span id="en-NIV-385" class="text Gen-16-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>So after Abram had been living in Canaan
 ten years,
 Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.</span> <span id="en-NIV-386" class="text Gen-16-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>He slept with Hagar,

</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-388" class="text Gen-16-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>“Your slave is in your hands,
” Abram said. “Do with her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai mistreated
 Hagar; so she fled from her.</span></p> <p><span id="en-NIV-389" class="text Gen-16-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>The angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>
 found Hagar near a spring
 in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.
</span> <span id="en-NIV-390" class="text Gen-16-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>And he said, “Hagar,
 slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?”
