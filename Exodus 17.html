    <h1>Exodus 17 - Literal Translation from the Masoretic Text</h1>
    
    <p><strong>1.</strong> And all the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to the command of God (YHWH), and they camped in Rephidim; and there was no water for the people to drink.</p>
    
    <p><strong>2.</strong> And the people quarreled with Moses, and they said, "Give us water, and we will drink." And Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test God (YHWH)?"</p>
    
    <p><strong>3.</strong> And the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, "Why is this? You brought us up from Egypt to kill me and my children and my livestock with thirst!"</p>
    
    <p><strong>4.</strong> And Moses cried out to God (YHWH), saying, "What shall I do for this people? A little more and they will stone me!"</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.</strong> And God (YHWH) said to Moses, "Pass before the people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel, and your staff with which you struck the river, take in your hand, and go."</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.</strong> Behold, I am standing before you there on the rock in Horeb, and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, and the people will drink." And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel.</p>
    
    <p><strong>7.</strong> And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the quarrel of the children of Israel, and because they tested God (YHWH), saying, "Is God (YHWH) in our midst or not?"</p>
    
    <p><strong>8.</strong> And Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</p>
    
    <p><strong>9.</strong> And Moses said to Joshua, "Choose men for us, and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God (YHWH) in my hand."</p>
    
    <p><strong>10.</strong> And Joshua did as Moses said to him, to fight with Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</p>
    
    <p><strong>11.</strong> And it was, when Moses lifted his hand, Israel prevailed, and when he rested his hand, Amalek prevailed.</p>
    
    <p><strong>12.</strong> And the hands of Moses were heavy, and they took a stone and placed it under him, and he sat on it. And Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one from this side and one from that side, and his hands were steady until the sun set.</p>
    
    <p><strong>13.</strong> And Joshua weakened Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.</p>
    
    <p><strong>14.</strong> And God (YHWH) said to Moses, "Write this as a remembrance in the book, and put it in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly erase the memory of Amalek from under the heavens."</p>
    
    <p><strong>15.</strong> And Moses built an altar, and he called its name <strong>God (YHWH) is My Banner</strong> (YHWH Nissi).</p>
    
    <p><strong>16.</strong> And he said, "For a hand is upon the throne of God (YHWH); war is for God (YHWH) with Amalek from generation to generation."</p>
